       "{'document': 'Moonlit shadows obscured them from the views of passerby , but Speedwagon \\'s only lament was that he could n\\'t see Jonathan \\'s beautiful eyes . Well , he could see them , but ... It was too dark . It was too dark for him to see much of anything , and he hated that darkness was the only thing to hide his shame . \" Robert ? \" his gentle voice queried , and Speedwagon winced as he bit too hard into his lip . \" Are you alright ? \" Of course he was n\\'t alright . This was wrong , what he felt was wrong , everything had gone so terribly wrong . Jonathan \\'s heart was pure and he was too good for Robert . The noble did n\\'t deserve to have his name tarnished by the rotten emotions of another man , never mind the rotten emotions of a notorious street thug . It was utterly pathetic , the way Robert \\'s heart raced in his chest when he saw his face , felt his hand on his back ... That same hand ( oh so large , capable of taking his breath away and warming his body ... ) now rested on his shoulder , and the silence of the world around them swallowed up his shaky inhale . William was n\\'t far , he could just walk back-- \" Robert ? \" Curse that voice , in all its low tones and comforting feelings . Jonathan was no fool ; he could read Robert like a book , knew that he was crawling in his skin . But he could n\\'t meet his gaze , could n\\'t look at him as he admitted his filthiest sin . \" \\' m in love with ya , Jonathan . \" Silence . He would n\\'t try and fill it ; God knows what he would say in all his convoluted words . He was waiting for the disappointment that came with such a confession , the disgust , with the knowledge that they could never go back to their blossoming friendship again . Robert knew , however , that if he did n\\'t get this off his chest that it would come out eventually . He knew better than anyone that you could n\\'t hide forever . Jonathan \\'s expression was unreadable . Robert \\'s heart painfully clenched , thinking back to how William was n\\'t too far away still and how he could escape this conversation entirely . But it would come back , it always came back-- \" ... We must nt speak of this . \" There it was , cutting through the hastily assembled barriers around his heart and knocking them all down in one fatal swing . The answer still managed to wind him like a punch to the gut , making his eyes well up with unshed tears , but Robert knew that a relationship with Jonathan was impossible , dangerous . Homosexuality was a sin , intermarriage between classes was frowned upon , desiring a taken man ( Erina sounded lovely ; Robert knew they would be a lovely couple ) was filthy . What a foolish decision he had made ... Jonathan would n\\'t even meet his eyes . All he could manage was a small , \" Of course , my apologies \" in lieu of all the sorrow he felt in his soul . They returned to where William was sound asleep , set up their own blankets around the waning fire , wished each other a good night , but Robert \\'s body ached with rejection . Jonathan would probably ask him to leave the group . Robert would go if he asked . Even with this thought lingering in the back of his mind and causing him a restless sleep , Robert \\'s greatest source of pain came from the thought of never seeing Jonathan \\'s beautiful eyes again . At least he could cherish the memory of their beautiful blue gazing at him with fondness , causing his chest a bittersweet tightness that made silent tears stream down his face . If he must go , then he would take those images in his mind with him , packed tightly in his heart despite the wrongness of his selfish behavior . When they awoke the next morning , Jonathan kept a distance from him , and Speedwagon was expecting that . What he was n\\'t expecting was the silent way Jonathan spoke to him . In the light of the sun , Speedwagon could see the features of the man he ... cared for with clarity , and it made his heart clench . He dared not observe him for too long ; that was n\\'t his place , it never was his place to gaze at him with such painful yearning . He knew better than to stumble over a dirty , unrequited broken heart . So , he kept his mouth shut and eyes forward , as if he were still back in London , where tight lips kept your head on your shoulders . \" Oh ! \" The sudden exclamation caught his attention . Speedwagon turned a curious glance towards Jonathan as he approached a barren tree . It was rather peculiar to see one of its kind amidst the blooming green of the surrounding area , but Speedwagon supposed its lack of sunlight was the reason for its current state . Regardless , something about it captured his attention , like he knew what it was supposed to be ... \" Mister Zeppeli , can I try something ? \" the larger man inquired , turning back to Speedwagon and William with a broad grin , and his warm look almost made Speedwagon flush with affection . Jonathan was always so excited by the smallest things ... It was one of the many things that attracted him to the nobleman in the first place . Among his conviction , his bravery , his loyalty-- \" Please ? It wo n\\'t be long ! \" --He was getting ahead of himself . Returning his attention back to the present , Speedwagon allowed himself the smallest smile , and turned to William to hear his response . With a slightly furrowed brow , William shrugged before turning on his heel to continue walking . \" Go ahead , \" he hummed , and Speedwagon peered at him more critically when he saw the hints of a smile on the other \\'s face . What was that look for ? Speedwagon did n\\'t have long to deliberate over it , as Jonathan \\'s Hamon breathing caught his attention once more , and he watched in fascination as small red buds grew on a once bare branch . How incredible ! His fingers , curled ever so delicately around the bark , transferring Hamon into the tree and creating life ... What Jonathan and William were capable of was truly remarkable . Jonathan seemed delighted by his achievement and took care to separate the branch with its buds from the tree with a happy laugh . It made his heart warm , seeing Jonathan succeed at something that obviously brought him so much joy ... \" Mister Speedwagon , \" came his cheery voice , and Speedwagon \\'s small lapse in awareness broke as the other approached him with the budded stick . God , he was hopeless in his attempts to be subtle . \" I do hope you \\'ll accept this ... Gift from me . \" Taking it from Jonathan \\'s hands , Speedwagon desperately ignored the way his palms brushed against Jonathan \\'s fingertips to observe the blossoms before him . They were ... Oh , god , he could feel his face heat up , his ears probably burning crimson-- Arbutus . Love . \" A - Ah ... Thank you , Mister Joestar , \" he managed to force out after a moment , his throat suddenly dry and heart racing as the meaning finally hit him like a ton of bricks . Jonathan ... Curse him and his noble upbringing , of course he would n\\'t want to be upfront about things . It was n\\'t becoming of the upper class to be explicit about anything ! He could n\\'t even meet the other \\'s suddenly soft expression , but Jonathan took one of his hands , bringing his knuckles to his lips and truly trying to kill Speedwagon by kissing them . With tenderness in his expression , Jonathan whispered , \" May I see you tonight ? \" and Robert was sure he was stuck in a dream . Jonathan ... He-- No . He could n\\'t get ahead of himself . \" Of course , Mister Joestar , \" he answered , just as quietly , and lifted his head in time to see the bright smile that split Jonathan \\'s face . That look alone made his cheeks flush once more , and he watched Jonathan walk after Zeppeli , feeling like he had hearts in his eyes . God , he was so infatuated with him ... This attraction of his was going to have him killed , he was sure of it . There was no way he could escape his feelings , knowing how they held his life captive , hanging him on that treacherous edge . But this ... Gift . What Jonathan had given him allowed him some reprise from that dangerous fall into execution . It made his heart beat slower in his chest , his breath even out , no longer captive under the vice of adrenaline that would grip his heart on a normal day . This branch of peace was like cold water applied to a burn he was n\\'t even aware of , liquid relief crying in his veins , and his eyes followed the broad back of Jonathan with shoulders less tense . Perhaps there was a chance , even if it was almost nonexistent . It was with heavy nerves that Speedwagon took a seat next to Jonathan , their shared bed for the night seeming even more terrifying now that it was a reality . He was n\\'t sure what to expect , honestly ; it was n\\'t every day that someone expressed a secret love to him , much less the man he had been absolutely pining for since their first meeting . However , fretting about the situation would n\\'t serve to make him feel better , so he simply had to trust what came next . \" Robert ... \" Jonathan spoke in a low rumble , and Robert \\'s heart raced in response to the intimate tone he had suddenly taken on . \" You simply caught me off guard last night ... I \\'m not used to intimacy being expressed so suddenly . \" There was a teasing lilt to his comment . Robert could n\\'t hide his pout before continuing to listen to what the other had to say . He still had n\\'t let his guard down . This was n\\'t a guarantee that Jonathan reciprocated his affections , and it was still wrong by societal standards . What they had to discuss should n\\'t be taken lightly-- \" You \\'re thinking too much . \" When had he gotten closer ? Robert felt the other \\'s breath ghost across his lips , and he had to suppress a shudder before biting his tongue resolutely . \" My apologies , Jonathan , \" he started , refusing to look away from their sudden eye contact and frazzle his nerves even more , \" I should n\\'t have said ... That . It \\'s crass for me to even feel that way about you . \" The look of hurt that briefly pinched Jonathan \\'s eyebrows made Robert want to kick himself , but he made it a point to slide his hand away from his thigh , not missing the way Jonathan \\'s own tried to take it . \" Why is it crass , Robert ? Is n\\'t it just love ? \" he uttered , almost pleadingly . Robert felt his teeth grit at the mention of the word he tried to avoid . How naive ... Even if Robert absolutely adored him to the ends of the Earth , he could n\\'t deny how blind Jonathan could be at times . Jonathan must have noticed Robert \\'s jaw tense , as his eyebrows furrowed further with some phantom pain . \" Please , talk to me , \" he murmured , \" tell me why you feel this way-- \" \" Damn you , it \\'s not that easy ! \" Robert growled , and he forced his head away as he felt his cheeks flush with anger . \" Relations between two men are illegal , Jonathan . It \\'s a crime ! The fact that I feel this way is disgusting ! -- \" \" Robert-- \" \" --The fact that I ca n\\'t stop feeling this way is pathetic ! It \\'s terrible , how much I love you ! \" Robert covered his mouth then , eyes wide and wet with tears . He had lost his composure . And poor Jonathan had been at the brunt of his sudden fury , the one person in the world who deserved it the least ... And he had said those words again , that made his tongue feel heavy and his stomach feel like a dead weight . Arbutus ... Jonathan had given him that branch , and was now talking to him about love ... What a fool he was . A large hand brushed against his cheek , and suddenly he was facing Jonathan , his intense , beautiful eyes boring into his own with that same passion that Robert had fallen for in the first place . He was breathtaking , and he did n\\'t belong to him , but a thumb brushed against his lower lip and his eyes fluttered at the gentleness and ... \" May I kiss you ? \" He wanted nothing more than to indulge Jonathan , to say yes and get lost in the feeling , but the panic in his chest rose at an alarming rate . \" How can you say these things with such a straight face ? \" he asked instead , breathless . Jonathan smiled sweetly before responding : \" Because I love you too , Robert . \" And he was gone . Tears sliding down his face now , he nodded numbly , and he almost let out a sob as their lips connected . Jonathan was so gentle , as Robert thought he would be , and left chaste pecks to his lips that made their act seem less of a sin and more romantic . He pulled away with a gasp for breath , his lips buzzing with sensation . He hid his face in Jonathan \\'s shoulder almost bashfully . He could n\\'t even look at the other man , his tender expression , and full , kissed lips , as his mind caught up with his heart . Jonathan loved him . And here he was , blushing like a virgin maiden , wanting nothing more than to indulge in their crime selfishly and completely . To soil Jonathan \\'s purity by kissing him more ... Yes , he wanted to kiss him more-- He wanted to kiss him until his lips were sore , red with attention and even fuller with love . \" My apologies , \" Jonathan rushed , pressing more kisses to Robert \\'s hair , with a desperation that made Robert flush harder , \" I ca n\\'t ... \" \" Do n\\'t apologize . \" He sounded so winded , so ruined already , but he moved in to kiss Jonathan once more , not nearly having had enough of him . \" You \\'ve done nothing wrong ... Absolutely nothing . \" Eventually they ended up against the bed , with Robert straddling his powerful thighs as they kissed . They never moved past that ; Jonathan would leave gentle pecks on his lips and cheeks while Robert kissed him more passionately , trying to convey his emotions where words failed . When their lips were kissed and bitten sore , they rested against one another , a firm tangle of limbs as they lay side - by - side . It was something out of Robert \\'s wildest dreams , his hands caressing the other \\'s face , feeling how Jonathan traced his scar and brushed their foreheads together affectionately , staring at each other like they were the only ones left in the world ... They had talked . Talked for hours , actually , fumbling over apologies and renewed confessions and eventually ending up in a tangle of limbs and kiss - bruised lips . They had spoken of their fears , their hopes , but above all else their love for each other , as soft as freshly fallen snow but vicious like the slap of winter air . They had come to terms , figured out ways to spell their affections to each other in ways that others would n\\'t catch on to , and ... And they never fell out of it . It was n\\'t a passion of the moment . It was truth , it was freedom , it was happiness , all culminated into one relationship that Robert could \\'ve never imagined in his wildest dreams . From the night he saw Erina tending to Jonathan \\'s bedside faithfully he believed there was never hope for him . But it was the furthest thing from what happened now . Now , the fear in his heart was gone . Instead of his heart racing from anxiety when Jonathan would kiss him , it would be from excitement , anticipating each and every press of lips to his own from the love of his life . The love of his life ... It was rather cliché . But it was a term he had grown attached to , finding it a fitting descriptor for how he felt about Jonathan . His mind was scattered , jumping from one thought to the next . Robert settled further into the couch with a soft sigh . Jonathan would eventually come to herd him to bed , seeing as the hour was late . And , almost like clockwork , Speedwagon picked up on the heavy footfalls of his lover in the next room . His lips quirked as he heard the other \\'s pace slow , as if he were trying to sneak up on him , and his eyes scanned the details of the table in front of him while he waited for whatever Jonathan had in store for him . He should know better , attempting to sneak up on a former street thug , but Jonathan had always been playful in his affections . Hands suddenly blocked his vision . Speedwagon suppressed a grin as he heard that lovely voice whisper , \" Guess who ? \" to him with all the softness in the world . Erina must have been asleep if he lowered his voice ; usually his laughter alone would be enough to shake the entire house . The feeling of his warm breath at his neck made his heart warm , and he firmly pushed back his anxieties at being caught as he leaned into the touch with a hum . \" Mmh ... An intruder , sent to kill me as I sit alone in the darkness ? \" Speedwagon heard his stifled laughter , and his heart thrummed harder in his chest . \" Fortunately , no . Any other guesses ? \" \" Perhaps a servant ? You \\'re handling me quite gently , stranger . \" Lips touched his earlobe . \" I handle you gently because I love you , dearest . I do n\\'t believe a servant would do such a thing . \" He could n\\'t help it anymore ; his lips split into a wide smile . He heard Jonathan \\'s breath hitch behind him , possibly seeing the love - awed grin on his face . \" Could it be ... My handsome , brave , kind Jonathan Joestar ? \" The hands were removed from his eyes , and Speedwagon observed with amusement as Jonathan eagerly rounded the couch to cup his cheeks more properly . Even after being with him for so long , the other \\'s reservations would never last long . Speedwagon could argue that this powerful affection only made him fall in love with the other more . Now that he could see , he greedily took in Jonathan \\'s defined cheekbones , his long lashes , those beautiful blue eyes , and gorgeously full lips . God , he had become a sap , he felt like he had hearts in his eyes as he gazed longer at the other \\'s beautiful face . \" Ah , it appears my handsome , brave , kind Robert Speedwagon has solved the mystery ! \" Even if he had heard those words spoken to describe him countless times before , his face still flushed with love , and he was met halfway as he leaned in to kiss Jonathan . Speedwagon remembered the bitter feeling in his throat that fateful night , the fear he felt at being intimate with Jonathan , but he could n\\'t focus on those thoughts anymore . No , all he could focus on now was the comforting weight of Jonathan \\'s hands on his face , guiding him into a deeper kiss , his tongue sliding across his lower lip as their blood warmed with anticipation . This had become new . Allowing himself to be laid back on the couch , with Jonathan maneuvering between his legs , their breaths hot and pulses thrumming ... Speedwagon pulled back with a wet gasp , feeling Jonathan \\'s weight settling against his hardening cock . \" Were n\\'t you going to force me to bed ? \" he murmured shakily and heard Jonathan \\'s grumbles of displeasure before he ground against him . Hard . \" We have n\\'t had much time alone , have we , Robert ? Your night owl behavior is the perfect excuse for us to make love . \" They had n\\'t had much time , between Erina \\'s pregnancy ( Speedwagon had admittedly spent too much time with his cheek pressed against her , feeling for the kicks of the baby ) and their usual daily activities . However , the wise part of Speedwagon \\'s mind still spoke louder than his desire . He attempted to get Jonathan off him . \" Jojo , we ai n\\'t got the time-- \" Attempting to move him was a futile effort , as Jonathan only pinned him down harder and growled a bit in his chest . He was by no means feral , but ... He had become a little spoiled between Erina and Speedwagon . \" Yes , we do , \" he uttered with finality , his eyes boring into Speedwagon before he gave him one more thrust against his hips . \" Is this ok with you , Robert ? We can go to bed if you wish . \" God , he loved him so much . Even when he was on the cusp of madness , overcome with lust and eager to make love to him , Jonathan always made sure he was ok to continue . Never overstepping his boundaries , as though this was for Speedwagon and not for them both-- \" Well , it would be rude to leave a man in this condition , would n\\'t it ? \" was his cheeky response , but the subtle , shaky exhale against his lips told Speedwagon that Jonathan saw how transparent he was with his love . From there it was a bit quick , not wishing to be caught but still desiring to partake in the pleasure of each other \\'s bodies as much as they could . When Jonathan took him into his mouth , sliding his tongue along the underside of his cock and swallowing the head with a grunt , Speedwagon felt tears in his eyes as he stifled an outcry . Never in a thousand lifetimes would he believe that he would find someone as perfect as Jonathan Joestar . \" Jojo ... Oh , Jojo ... \" he breathed , covering his mouth to stifle a breathy moan as his thighs tensed around the other \\'s head . Ages ago Speedwagon would \\'ve felt incredible fear and shame , believing this to be wrong and disgusting and dangerous , but ... Jonathan gave him nothing to be afraid of . They faced their battles together , fought through every obstacle and came out better people . Jonathan had n\\'t saved his life , but he gave it new meaning , new purpose . He helped Speedwagon to accept himself , to love who he was as Jonathan loved him , and give that love back without regret . It was hardly believable that Speedwagon had grown so much since their first encounter , but-- Oh , oh , he wanted him to do that again , tongue the tip of his dick and squeeze the shaft in such a perfect way-- And he was almost there , one hand buried in the other \\'s tousled strands as his thighs squeezed his head tighter , wetness on his blushing cheeks as he bit back sobs . His love for Jonathan was so immense , so powerful , it brought forth so many strong emotions for him and it was almost impossible to quell them in this moment . He was trembling so hard , he was almost worried that Erina would hear him and have her rest disturbed , but Jonathan \\'s large hands came to hold his hips and he went lax with his sudden orgasm . Rolling his hips as much as he could in Jonathan \\'s grip , Speedwagon shuddered blissfully and let out a low whine , feeling Jonathan \\'s hum of satisfaction vibrate his core and causing his cock to throb weakly in response . He was boneless and in love , watching with an adoring gaze as Jonathan peeled his thighs from his head with a small grin . \" What are you looking at ? \" Jonathan hummed teasingly , kissing the inside of his thigh . Speedwagon felt his heart pound harder in his chest . \" The love of my life , \" was his response , and even with the dim lighting Speedwagon could see the flush of color erupt on Jonathan \\'s cheeks . A great effort was made to pull himself up . Jonathan attempted to stop him , offering to carry him to bed with the remark that he must be tired , but Speedwagon felt the thrum of lust stronger in his body than fatigue . He wanted to suck Jonathan \\'s dick , wanted to make him feel good , wanted to feel those strong fingers gripping his hair and guiding him to where he needed it the most ... \" Let me , \" he almost pleaded , his emotions roaring back as he settled himself on Jonathan \\'s lap , \" I want to , Jojo , you made me feel so good ... \" A strained groan left Jonathan \\'s chest as Speedwagon laid himself on his stomach , pressing his lips to the hardness in his sleep pants . \" I love you so much , Jojo , so much ... \" Admittedly , he could get a little sappy when they made love . Jonathan \\'s laughter was sweet while Speedwagon made quick work of his clothing . \" I love you t - hnh ! Robert ! \" Jonathan felt so good in his mouth , a heavy weight against his tongue , a pleasant stretch in his jaw . The taste of him was so unique , and the noises he made ... Now , as Speedwagon let the head of his thickness slip past his lips , Jonathan let out small , muffled whimpers . He loved him , loved how vocal he was ... From there he made quick work of sucking Jonathan off , languidly stroking his cock as he attempted to fit as much of him in his mouth as he could . Occasionally he would come back up for breath , digging his tongue into the tip of his dick as he watched Jonathan \\'s face for the minute expressions of pleasure he would make . His handsome face was flushed with exertion , his full lips parted on whining exhales and needy inhales , looking pained as he had to hold his sounds of pleasure back . He was so , so beautiful ... More tears gathered in his eyes , but he held them off , taking Jonathan into his mouth as much as possible before grabbing at the other \\'s ass and squeezing . He could tell Jonathan was close . His stomach was tensing , and he probably had his head tipped back , exposing the expanse of his throat as he bit into his lip . There was no more anxiety in his heart , all he wanted was to feel Jonathan cum in his throat , show him just how much he loved being intimate with him in this way . Forcing his throat to relax , taking one large inhale , he lowered himself the rest of the way down Jonathan \\'s cock . Speedwagon could feel him in his throat , throbbing hard as Jonathan let out a small cry . \" O - Ooh , Rob - Robert ... Robert , darling , \" he babbled , and Speedwagon swallowed to hear him bite back a keen . \" Gon na ... Gon na cum , love , my love , my-- d - dearest-- ! \" The soft sob Jonathan let out would be forever burned into Robert \\'s memory , and he held still as Jonathan came down his throat with an appreciative squeeze . His head felt fuzzy with the feeling , his mind going hazy as arousal flooded his gut once more , but he pulled his head back to take in a much - needed breath of air . His throat would be sore tomorrow , but it was all worth it to see those beautiful eyes glossed over with post - orgasmic affection . \" My ... When did you learn that Robert ? \" Jonathan spoke softly , his cheeks flushed as he scrambled to set himself to rights . It was rather adorable , how he was embarrassed by his own noisiness . Speedwagon loved that about him . Hell , he loved everything about him , who was he kidding ? A hand went to stroke his hair , and Speedwagon hummed with content . \" Mmh ... Recently ... Learnt it just for you , Jojo , \" came his almost purr . Joy sung in his heart as Jonathan kissed his neck . This love of his was so soft , so tender , nothing like the raging fire that burned while he was pining after Jonathan . It did n\\'t hurt him , did n\\'t throw scathing words at him and threaten him . Instead it was scratching his scalp pleasantly , leaving ticklish kisses along his jaw that made him bunch his shoulders and laugh . It was true , it was beautiful ... It was Jonathan . It always has been Jonathan , the love of his life , his light and anchor . Once he had thought this love was nothing but tainted , only promising bad omens and suffering for the both of them . However , it was Jonathan who pulled Speedwagon from those depressing thoughts and made him understand that there was never truly anything wrong with the way he felt . The way they felt . Once , Speedwagon never believed he had a chance . Once , Speedwagon thought that this was a dangerous endeavor . But when he looked at Jonathan and saw those familiar blues staring back at him with nothing but love , the planes of his handsome face illuminated by the dying candlelight and his tousled wavy locks sticking to his face with sweat ... He had nothing to fear . Their love was stronger than fear , and it would carry them through all the troubles they faced together .',\n",
