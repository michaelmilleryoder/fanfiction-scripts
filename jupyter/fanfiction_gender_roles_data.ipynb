Proving his madness , Sirius  laughed aloud then . `` No , Sirius  \\'m -- ! No ! What? Is Lily  what \\'s had Severus  knicks in a twist all these years ? \\'\\' `` Yes , \\'\\' Severus  replied immediately , though Severus  teeth . Severus  looked away quickly , but Sirius  had got Sirius  . `` Because people are awful to Severus  , \\'\\' Severus  ground out , jerking a hand at Sirius  as an example . `` Severus  become defensive and Severus  hurt them before they can hurt Severus  . \\'\\' Severus  refused to allow Severus  to colour with embarrassment . `` Why have Severus  always hated Severus  so ? \\'\\' `` Because Severus  remind Severus  of Severus  , \\'\\' Sirius  snapped . \\'\\' ... of the Blacks . \\'\\' `` It \\'s for Lily  that Lily  \\'re helping Harry  now , is n\\'t it ? \\'\\' Sirius  asked . `` And yet Lily  treat him appallingly Lily  , \\'\\' Sirius  pointed out . Sirius  frowned , shook his head . `` That absolutely is n\\'t the truth , \\'\\' he said carefully . `` Nothing about that is true . \\'\\' `` Are Severus  loyal to Dumbledore ? \\'\\' Sirius  eventually asked . `` No , I \\'m only loyal to my family . \\'\\' James  clearly did n\\'t refer to the ancient and most noble house of Black  . There was another long silence . Each man watched the other carefully , unsure what to make of this development . Sirius  drank more of the dosed wine . `` Of course not , \\'\\' Sirius  said with a shrug . `` Sirius  were at war -- and not regular war , mind you , special evil racist wizard war , \\'\\' James  elaborated unnecessarily , grimly amused by James  own summation . `` She fell pregnant , James  was -- James  loved James  dearly , you understand , but James  was an absolute tit , James  really was . The -- Sirius  whole lives were a trainwreck and Sirius  all knew it . None of Sirius  were happy , but Sirius  were young , and that \\'s enough sometimes ... James  want to talk about something else . \\'\\' Severus  began to wonder if Severus  had perhaps tipped a bit more into Sirius  goblet than was required -- the man was beginning to sound quite alarmingly drugged , not a typical reaction at all . Well , that or Severus  was just already sauced . Considering Severus  bony frame , either was equally likely . `` No , \\'\\' Sirius  said . `` Afraid I have n\\'t had the pleasure of shagging Merlin  , I could n\\'t tell Severus  anything about that . \\'\\' `` Because he lived so long ago , \\'\\' he blurted . Sirius  paused , confused . He seemed to consult a patch of space immediately in front of his face . His focus slowly lengthened until he was looking at Severus  again . `` I do n\\'t understand . Why what?\" `` To Severus  , perhaps . Which means , incidentally , that James  owes me five squids , wherever James  is . \\'\\' James  ignored the werewolf issue altogether ; Remus was as human as James  . Sirius  briefly consulted the space in front of James  eyes again . `` We ... fit . We were attracted to each other . James  understood me , I understood James  . \\'\\' `` We know James  turned coat for us , \\'\\' James  said then . `` Which means James  first loyalty was to them . \\'\\' Eyes narrowed , James  drew out a cigarette . `` James  , \\'\\' James  said , pausing to spark it on James  knuckle , \\'\\' participated . Willingly.\" It was clear Sirius  would never forgive James  for it , whatever truths Sirius  were sharing tonight notwithstanding . Sirius  seemed to regard Severus  with something like sympathy or even understanding for a bare second , but then Severus  smirked , cruelly . `` James  was a pureblood , just like me . You \\'ve been envious all along . \\'\\' `` I did the same , \\'\\' Sirius  blurted around the filter of Severus  cigarette . `` That night , at the willow . I tried to frighten you because I thought it would make me feel better about being so much like you , so much like the whole pureblooded serpent \\'s nest I \\'d come from . I never thought you \\'d go . I thought it would prove that you were a coward , that I was better than you because I was brave enough to face him -- \\'\\' `` It \\'s no wonder they made you ` ead-of - ` ouse , \\'\\' Sirius  drawled , dropping his haiches in a momentary and deliberate eschewing of his class -- like using ` squids \\' for a bet . He took a long drag . `` Yes ... \\'\\' Sirius  said slowly , and he sounded sad . He might not have been sorry for the effect his prank had had on Severus  , particularly . `` Do you feel remorse ? For the people you killed ? Because of their blood-status ? \\'\\' `` Mordred  \\'s cock , you really are into Mordred  , \\'\\' Sirius  observed . `` I \\'m proud of Mordred  , sir . Mordred  may be my greatest accomplishment in life . \\'\\' He shrugged . `` It \\'s not as though I had a choice in the matter . \\'\\' Sirius  shrugged again as if that settled the matter , grinning mildly . Sirius  nodded . `` Because I was born a blood-traitor , and I knew it early . I never had a choice in which side to take . \\'\\' Sirius  grinned wickedly . he prodded , still slurring charmingly , for he was n\\'t bound to answer a question half-asked . `` Motorbike enthusiasts ? Avid readers ? Drinkers of black coffee ? \\'\\' Sirius  pursed his lips in a considering sort of way ; at length he shrugged . `` I do n\\'t think so , \\'\\' he finally said , grinding his cigarette out on the table . `` Of course I do . Now.\" Sirius  was silent for a moment , again consulting the middle distance . `` I should have trusted Lupin  along . \\'\\' Sirius  quite overarched a single brow , in a magnificent display of aristocratic disdain . `` Other way ` round , darling , \\'\\' he said , his now dramatically slow and precise diction seething-facetious . `` Oh , or did you mean his furry little problem ? \\'\\' Sirius  looked haughty , but Severus  admitted , `` Severus  \\'m sure Remus would thank you to bring some wolfsbane potion next week . \\'\\' `` It makes Severus  much more comfortable , \\'\\' Sirius  clarified , still a touch overproud . There was a long silence . Then , a not-so-subtle highborn dismissal , `` Was there anything else ? \\'\\' Sirius  nodded , seemed to consider for a moment , then Severus  met the other man \\'s eyes again . `` Did you really love her ? \\'\\' Severus  asked then . `` Lily  , Severus  mean . \\'\\' `` Sometimes I think I know that feeling , \\'\\' Sirius  admitted with a wry quirk of the lip . `` You and I , we were always far too similar . \\'\\' And then , turning it into a sly grin , Severus  stood and drew something small out of Severus  waistcoat pocket . Leaning forward over the table , Severus  set it down before the other man \\'s glass . `` Goodnight , Severus , it \\'s been a pleasure , \\'\\' Severus  said sweetly , and then Severus  turned to go , waving over Severus  shoulder as Severus  left the room . It was a tiny , ornate phial , empty now . The little parchment tag , labelled in Sirius  \\' own hand , read Draught of Silver-Tongue .'"
