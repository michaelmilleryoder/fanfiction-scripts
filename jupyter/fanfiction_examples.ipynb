A comment made me think about needing to explain why I had John react the way he did, which was VERY NOT GOOD.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Why I had John force Sherlock to show him.  This is pretty much a copy/paste of a comment response that made me think perhaps I should explain.\\nThis comes down to my character interpretation of John based on what I’ve gleaned from the show and interviews.  Yours may be totally different and I am all for that, it’s the fun of art and who am I to tell someone they are interpreting something wrong?  My interpretation of John is that he is not a healthy person.  He may be the healthier of the two, but that’s like being the valedictorian of summer school.  Congratulations, of all the people who suck you suck the least.  I think John’s calm, stable, and selfless demeanor is just a front.  A good one, but a front.\\na.\\tJohn has trust issues and PTSD. He buries it, but it’s there.  His adventures with Sherlock are a coping mechanism.  I think we were supposed to read John as suicidal in ASiP.\\nb.\\tJohn can’t confront his emotions.  In show—and mentioned by the powers that be—he drinks when he’s uncomfortable and has to deal with something he doesn’t want to.  I kind of tried to allude to that with Mycroft and the scotch.  Mycroft knows.\\nc.\\tJohn has epic jealousy issues when it comes to Sherlock; he doesn’t like when people get close to him—Irene, Janine, even Moriarty makes John jealous—and I think part of it is that there is someone besides him privy to Sherlock’s secrets.  He even does it with Molly!  From his blog, “He even replaced me! I refused to go back to Baker Street so he replaced me with Molly Hooper and started solving cases while he worked on the terrorist thing.”  Calm yourself, John.\\nd.\\tThe one time John tried to sit down and ask Sherlock how he was—after Irene—it was awful and awkward and he had a drink, one of his other coping mechanisms.\\ne.\\tHis BFF—and possibly love of his life, your YMMV—“died,” left him alone to grieve to who knows what extent (we never see all of it), he falls in love with an assassin, then his BFF comes back from what John is sure was a FANTASTIC ADVENTURE having left him alone to be miserable, and after everything he did for Sherlock.  John Watson has trust issues, and Sherlock lied to him after watching him commit suicide.  John attacks him when he comes back, because he’s LIVID.  It’s not healthy, but it’s not unbelievable either.  It’s human.\\nf.\\tWhy I think John was under the impression Sherlock was out having a blast without him, again from his blog, “I knew that he was out there having the time of his life and I was... working.”  John probably had no idea how horrible it was.  In my reading, John thinks Sherlock was on an adventure and John was miserable.\\ng.\\tThe other important person in his life lied to him.  John’s outburst in the apartment was…less than calm.  I think he was truly trying to hold himself back from beating the shit out of everything in sight.  The man with trust issues was lied to, AGAIN.\\nSo, now back to my story—which is kind of a way of writing metas for what I think is going on in my interpretations—it’s after HLV and Sherlock is Sherlock and Moriarty is back (more coming in the future) and he’s free of Mary and finally thinking he’s getting Sherlock to open up to him and he’s slowly working his John “Three Continents” Watson magic on his repressed, uppity BFF who he loves and BAM.  There’s more being kept from him.  His person is STILL lying to him, and he is battling trying to be understanding and his residual anger over being left back in London and that betrayal and he has to KNOW and Sherlock is still trying to lie to him.\\nDo I think it was the right thing to do?  No.  No no no.  Violence is never the answer (unless it is) but it’s not in this.  But this is a troubled, unhealthy man with trust issues and PTSD who is fed up being lied to.  I tried to have John feeling bad in the next one because the right thing to do would be sit and be gentle but in my interpretation of John, and my own experiences with mental health issues, it’s kind of a fairy tale.  Sometimes upset humans don’t do what they know they’re supposed to.   And it’ll come up again, with John knowing his reaction wasn’t the best.\\nYour character interpretation may be totally different, but this is mine and why I kind of had him go ape-shit and force Sherlock to do it.  I just wanted to explain so you didn’t think I was using borderline domestic violence for the purposes of angst.</td>\n",

       "18850  Why I had John force Sherlock to show him.  This is pretty much a copy/paste of a comment response that made me think perhaps I should explain.\\nThis comes down to my character interpretation of John based on what I’ve gleaned from the show and interviews.  Yours may be totally different and I am all for that, it’s the fun of art and who am I to tell someone they are interpreting something wrong?  My interpretation of John is that he is not a healthy person.  He may be the healthier of the two, but that’s like being the valedictorian of summer school.  Congratulations, of all the people who suck you suck the least.  I think John’s calm, stable, and selfless demeanor is just a front.  A good one, but a front.\\na.\\tJohn has trust issues and PTSD. He buries it, but it’s there.  His adventures with Sherlock are a coping mechanism.  I think we were supposed to read John as suicidal in ASiP.\\nb.\\tJohn can’t confront his emotions.  In show—and mentioned by the powers that be—he drinks when he’s uncomfortable and has to deal with something he doesn’t want to.  I kind of tried to allude to that with Mycroft and the scotch.  Mycroft knows.\\nc.\\tJohn has epic jealousy issues when it comes to Sherlock; he doesn’t like when people get close to him—Irene, Janine, even Moriarty makes John jealous—and I think part of it is that there is someone besides him privy to Sherlock’s secrets.  He even does it with Molly!  From his blog, “He even replaced me! I refused to go back to Baker Street so he replaced me with Molly Hooper and started solving cases while he worked on the terrorist thing.”  Calm yourself, John.\\nd.\\tThe one time John tried to sit down and ask Sherlock how he was—after Irene—it was awful and awkward and he had a drink, one of his other coping mechanisms.\\ne.\\tHis BFF—and possibly love of his life, your YMMV—“died,” left him alone to grieve to who knows what extent (we never see all of it), he falls in love with an assassin, then his BFF comes back from what John is sure was a FANTASTIC ADVENTURE having left him alone to be miserable, and after everything he did for Sherlock.  John Watson has trust issues, and Sherlock lied to him after watching him commit suicide.  John attacks him when he comes back, because he’s LIVID.  It’s not healthy, but it’s not unbelievable either.  It’s human.\\nf.\\tWhy I think John was under the impression Sherlock was out having a blast without him, again from his blog, “I knew that he was out there having the time of his life and I was... working.”  John probably had no idea how horrible it was.  In my reading, John thinks Sherlock was on an adventure and John was miserable.\\ng.\\tThe other important person in his life lied to him.  John’s outburst in the apartment was…less than calm.  I think he was truly trying to hold himself back from beating the shit out of everything in sight.  The man with trust issues was lied to, AGAIN.\\nSo, now back to my story—which is kind of a way of writing metas for what I think is going on in my interpretations—it’s after HLV and Sherlock is Sherlock and Moriarty is back (more coming in the future) and he’s free of Mary and finally thinking he’s getting Sherlock to open up to him and he’s slowly working his John “Three Continents” Watson magic on his repressed, uppity BFF who he loves and BAM.  There’s more being kept from him.  His person is STILL lying to him, and he is battling trying to be understanding and his residual anger over being left back in London and that betrayal and he has to KNOW and Sherlock is still trying to lie to him.\\nDo I think it was the right thing to do?  No.  No no no.  Violence is never the answer (unless it is) but it’s not in this.  But this is a troubled, unhealthy man with trust issues and PTSD who is fed up being lied to.  I tried to have John feeling bad in the next one because the right thing to do would be sit and be gentle but in my interpretation of John, and my own experiences with mental health issues, it’s kind of a fairy tale.  Sometimes upset humans don’t do what they know they’re supposed to.   And it’ll come up again, with John knowing his reaction wasn’t the best.\\nYour character interpretation may be totally different, but this is mine and why I kind of had him go ape-shit and force Sherlock to do it.

When Winter comes, and singing ends; when darkness falls at last;\\nWhen broken is the barren bough, and light and labour past;\\nI'll look for thee, and wait for thee, until we meet again:\\nTogether we will take the road beneath the bitter rain!\\n(from \"Treebeard\", The Two Towers )</td>\n",

In this universe, the low sexual dimorphism among elves means that all elves are capable of breast feeding, and the spouse who doesn't carry the baby undergoes the hormonal changes naturally during their partner's pregnancy to allow it. They then take primary care of the baby after it's born for the same period of time as it takes to carry a baby (so one year of the sun or one-tenth of a year of the trees), allowing their partner to recover and themselves to bond with their child. Pregnancy and birth have a very taxing effect on their spirits, so the recovery period is entirely necessary. Elf transition can happen at any life point, just like humans, some of them were trans since birth and realize right away, some realize later, and some will describe it as a distinct change later in life from one thing to another. They can effect their bodies with their spirits, so the physical transition happens naturally, but takes some time. Maedhros and Fingon got elf-married in secret in Valinor and Fingolfin (and everyone) found out about it after the rescue. I think that covers all the head canons I'm using here. Enjoy!</td>\n",

       "110    1) Maedhros and Fingon are (cis) rule 63'd. If you don't like rule 63, please read something else that you will enjoy instead.\\n2) Gil Galad is Maedhros and Fingon's child, created partly using and enchantment, but Fingon was the gestational parent.\\n3) Fingolfin is portrayed here as a trans man.\\n4) this is mostly an excuse for me to put my weird headcanons about elf anatomy, culture, reproduction, and gender in a fic. In this universe, the low sexual dimorphism among elves means that all elves are capable of breast feeding, and the spouse who doesn't carry the baby undergoes the hormonal changes naturally during their partner's pregnancy to allow it. They then take primary care of the baby after it's born for the same period of time as it takes to carry a baby (so one year of the sun or one-tenth of a year of the trees), allowing their partner to recover and themselves to bond with their child. Pregnancy and birth have a very taxing effect on their spirits, so the recovery period is entirely necessary. Elf transition can happen at any life point, just like humans, some of them were trans since birth and realize right away, some realize later, and some will describe it as a distinct change later in life from one thing to another. They can effect their bodies with their spirits, so the physical transition happens naturally, but takes some time. Maedhros and Fingon got elf-married in secret in Valinor and Fingolfin (and everyone) found out about it after the rescue. I think that covers all the head canons I'm using here. Enjoy!   \n",

Fluff, angst, whatever you give me I will love.\\nRating up to R.\\nI am indebted to Ignoblebard who stepped up the plate to edit my story, thank you for your great suggestions and feedback.   \n",
