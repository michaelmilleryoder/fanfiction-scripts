At this stage we 're not pursuing legislation , \" Ms Burney said . &lt;p&gt; \" But I do want further discussion . I do want further community education and understanding around this issue , because at the end of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caring relationship and that 's what 's important . \" &lt;p&gt; There is a quirk in the law , however , as single gay men and women are allowed to adopt , and gay couples are allowed to foster children . &lt;p&gt; Kellie McDonald , the co-convenor of the NSW Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby , says adoption is the last piece of legislation in the state that still discriminates against same-sex couples and their families . &lt;p&gt; \" The primary concern should be what are the best interests of the children , and the Government has recognised that , \" she said . &lt;p&gt; \" It should n't be pandering to other groups ' opinions if they believe that these reforms would be in the best interest of the child . \" &lt;h&gt; Calls for national approach &lt;p&gt; A leading human rights and anti-discrimination lawyer , Wayne Morgan , says there are human rights attached to family life . &lt;p&gt; \" This is set out in a number of international covenants , in the human rights legislation that we have in some states and territories in Australia , \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have two legally recognised parents , so I would say this adoption rights issue is a human rights issue . &lt;p&gt; \" Not in and of itself , but in terms of the human right to a family and in terms of the best interests of the child . \" &lt;p&gt; Mr Morgan dismisses the suggestion the NSW community is not ready for same-sex adoption . &lt;p&gt; \" Surveys reflect that the average Australian thinks gay men and lesbians should be allowed to marry , to adopt , indeed , be allowed to make use of artificial reproductive technologies to have their own children , \" he said . &lt;p&gt; \" So given that level of acceptance in the community , this scaring of horses , I would ask , well , what horses are we scaring ? &lt;p&gt; \" I would challenge the NSW Government , or any government , to put forward a valid , rational reason as to why the reforms should not go ahead . \" &lt;p&gt; There are now growing calls for the Federal Government to take over adoption laws . &lt;p&gt; A spokesman for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is inconsistency across the country because there is adoption protection in Tasmania , the ACT and Western Australia . &lt;p&gt; \" Victoria and NSW have this as a live issue by referring it for a national approach , \" Mr Irlam said . &lt;p&gt; \" But from a child 's perspective , it should n't matter which state they live in , they should be entitled to a loving and legal recognition of two parents . \"</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;h&gt; Titillating talk &lt;p&gt; I would n't call myself an exhibitionist but I 'm not exactly a prude , either . For example : I 've been known to press my bare bum up against the back window of a moving vehicle but only in salute to people I know . True story . &lt;p&gt; I 've had reason to ponder my sense of modesty recently due to the fact that fourteen weeks ago , I cranked one out ( read : had a baby ) . Since The Sprout 's birth , my level of self-consciousness when it comes to my breasts has diminished to the point of non-existence . And you know what ? I 've decided it 's a good thing . &lt;p&gt; When I was first learning to breastfeed in hospital I felt a bit weird about exposing my breastfeeding equipment to a complete stranger ( the midwife , not The Sprout ) , but by the time I 'd had practically every member of staff on duty manipulate my mammaries in the name of teaching me the right breastfeeding technique , I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite literally up for grabs . Seriously - if Gary from the cafeteria had told me he had a great way of avoiding cracked nipples there 's every chance that within seconds I would have been tops-off for a demonstration at the bain-marie . &lt;p&gt; While in hospital I spent literally hours with my chest exposed : learning to feed , actually feeding and then letting my fledgling feedbags recover from The Sprout 's wonderfully hearty appetite ( I learned that you apply a lanolin-based salve and then let them air-dry . Do n't tumble-dry them - they shrink ) . &lt;p&gt; I spent more time topless than a slapper at schoolies and it got to the point where I had to check myself before I set foot outside my hospital room lest I give any visitors in the corridor the impression that the dress code if you 've just had an emergency caesarean is \" semi-nude . \" &lt;p&gt; During The Sprout 's first weeks at home the trend continued . One day I looked through the shots on our digital camera and remarked to The Bloke that I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked why he had n't taken as many of me . He answered that it was because I constantly had my boobs out . When I responded that surely that made for golden photo opportunities his reply was : \" I do n't know - you do n't want too many heads in one shot . \" &lt;p&gt; Having achieved such a level of gay abandon when it comes to breastfeeding in hospital and at home , my challenge now is how best to approach breastfeeding in public . &lt;p&gt; After reading that one in four people surveyed in a 2009 Newspoll considered it \" unacceptable \" to breastfeed a baby in a restaurant or caf ? , I 'm not sure how I 'll tackle the situation if anyone has a problem with the fact that my cups runneth over and The Sprout gets a crack at them whenever she likes . &lt;p&gt; And have no doubt : people are n't shy about telling nursing mothers what they think . One of my dear friends was quick off the mark in the food court of a shopping plaza recently when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breastfeeding her baby in a public toilet : she challenged them to eat their lunch in there . &lt;p&gt; Never mind that thanks to anti-discrimination laws , breastfeeding in public is legal everywhere in Australia . Never mind that the woman making the suggestion had her own children in tow and regardless of whether or not she breastfed them , she would have known that when a baby 's hungry their need should be met . And never mind that my friend was making every effort to be discreet - it 's not like she was standing topless on a table outside Gloria Jean 's offering anyone who did n't get enough milk in their latte a free squirt . &lt;p&gt; The double standards when it comes to norgs are baffling : why is it okay for women to get the girls out in a low-cut outfit when they 're dressing to impress but apparently not as okay for them to expose just enough to feed their babies ? How can one of the most basic and natural human functions be considered titillating ? ( And whose idea was it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tit ? ' ) &lt;p&gt; At the pub for lunch on the weekend The Sprout demanded her version of a parma and pot , so after throwing one of her light cotton wraps over my shoulder to give us some privacy I whipped out a boob and obliged . In the packed beer garden , nobody batted an eyelid . Just as well : on the outside I projected serene nonchalance but on the inside I was steeling myself to glass anyone who complained .</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;h&gt; Sex , Drugs , But No Violence : A Porn Game With A Message &lt;p&gt; Video game developer Andrew Hall makes no bones about his lifestyle or the game he helped make that revels in it . &lt;p&gt; \" I have consensual sex and I do drugs , \" he told Kotaku in a recent interview . \" I 've never killed anybody before . But in video games you just go kill people all day , it 's like nothing . Bam , that person 's dead . Bam , that person 's dead . That really desensitises you . Murder is a big fucking deal . \" &lt;p&gt; That 's why third-person action , triple-X sex game Bonetown does n't include any blood or even the ability to kill people , instead you knock people unconscious during combat . &lt;p&gt; Hall , CEO of game developer D-Dub Software , sees the video game industry 's willingness to allow graphic violence controlled by gamers , but its refusal to include sex or overt drug references as hypocrisy . &lt;p&gt; He knows that Bonetown , a cartoonish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost non-stop drug use , wo n't change that , but he hopes it will help create a business model for other sex games that wo n't include having to go through the game industry to market and sell the title . &lt;p&gt; In the game , the player arrives in the fictitious Bonetown as man with no friends . The first woman that befriends him has sex with the player on the beach and \" shows you the way of Bonetown , \" Hall says . But then she gets arrested by \" The Man \" because they just passed the decency act in the town . &lt;p&gt; \" So The Man , who is pretty much corporate America and the video game industry , is trying to make Bonetown a decent place with no sex and drugs , \" Hall explains . \" You see The Man coming in and messing with Bonetown and then the last missions take you to The Man 's lair to stop The Man from moralising Bonetown and keeping from being the place where sex and drugs are free to be everywhere . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safely described in the context of an article that can be read at work or in the view of children . The PC game can be controlled with an Xbox controller and feels a bit like an open-world action game . While there are chapters that need to eventually be completed to finish the narrative of the story , players are able to freely roam around the game 's many different settings . &lt;p&gt; \" This is an adult game , but it 's not just about jerking off , \" Hall says , \" it 's about playing a video game too . \" &lt;p&gt; Players can approach any woman on the street and ask to have one of three types of sex with her . Her willingness to have sex will depend on the size of the character 's testicles , which are graphically represented by a cartoon in the top left corner of the game 's screen . A character can grow his testicles by having more and more sex or using some of the game 's many drugs . &lt;p&gt; The drugs in the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both give the player a temporary boost and provide them with a special attack that can be used against The Man 's agents that roam the city streets . &lt;p&gt; Hall said that the developers decided to give the game a cartoon look , because trying to make it photo-realistic would have lead to failure . &lt;p&gt; \" If you want to make a game about sex you could n't make the girls look realistic because there is that uncanny barrier , \" he said . \" Once you get so realistic it starts to get less realistic . So what we did , we tried to merge anime and Disney together . &lt;p&gt; \" Look at our girls , they have the big eyes , but it 's not the shroomed-out big anime eyes . And we had to go cartoon because we wanted our girls to be sexy . We wanted the Jessica Rabbit appeal of ' this is obviously a cartoon , but it 's still arousing to me ' . \" &lt;p&gt; Currently the game , which is packed with sexual positions and tons of graphic cartoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that will change . &lt;p&gt; \" Right now it is straight sex only , \" he said . \" The gay market is n't that big in video games . Gay men play video games , but we needed to hit the core market first , the 18 to 35 heterosexual males . We would love to expand to gay , we could add more sex positions too . \" &lt;p&gt; While sex and drugs play a big role in the game , comedy is also a chief element . &lt;p&gt; \" It 's really over-the-top comedy , \" Hall said . \" When it comes to the comedy South Park is our number one main influence . \" &lt;p&gt; The humour of the game is built into the combat , the character design and the levels , and is certainly helped along by the main character 's ability to assume the identity of anyone he defeats in combat . &lt;p&gt; For instance , Hall says , both \" White Jesus \" and \" Black Jesus \" are in the game . To prove it Hall ran his character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firmwood Forest \" where he found a laid back , meditative , pot-smoking Jesus hanging out at a campsite . &lt;p&gt; \" Jesus is chilling in the woods , \" Hall says as he approaches him . \" In Bonetown Jesus is a stoner . \" &lt;p&gt; Once Hall 's character lays into Jesus with a mannequin arm , the Jesus character starts to fight back with a cross yelling at the Hall 's character in a tirade that always ends in the word \" man . \" &lt;p&gt; After dancing around kegs of water and wine , and swatting at Jesus with the prosthetic , Hall finally knocks Jesus to the ground . Standing over him he presses a button and transforms . &lt;p&gt; \" Now I 'm Jesus , \" Hall says smiling . &lt;p&gt; Despite how adeptly Hall beat Jesus in combat , he says he does n't really play violent games . Well , maybe a few . &lt;p&gt; \" I play Grand Theft Auto because I think it 's funny , \" he says . \" I do n't like the new one The new Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you 're really a person in Liberty City and you 're really killing people , you know what I mean ? \" &lt;p&gt; Bonetown has plenty of weapons , Hall concedes , but none of them cause a character to bleed . &lt;p&gt; \" One thing , we did n't want was blood in the game , \" he said . \" We wanted to be able to have a little bit of moral standing against the video game industry , say , ' You guys in Grand Theft Auto get to go kill women and children and have blood everywhere . ' In our game all there is is consensual sex , there 's no rape , nothing like that , there 's no blood , you never kill anyone , you 're just knocking them out . &lt;p&gt; \" It 's consensual sex and drugs and is that really so much worse than killing people ? \" &lt;p&gt; More frustrating in my mind is the fact that there is very little separation between \" nudity \" and \" sexual content \" . &lt;p&gt; Are we that sexually stunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has the ability to do almost anything ( including graphically killing other people ) , we deem the sight of a naked body underneath armor and clothing to be vulgar and unnecessary ? &lt;p&gt; Sounds like a game that 'd never make it to Australia . Even with an R18+ and/or X18+ rating , the drug use would instantly place it as Refused Classification ( not to mention that it combines sex and violence ) . &lt;p&gt; I 'm really sick of comments like these \" But in video games you just go kill people all day , it 's like nothing . Bam , that person 's dead . Bam , that person 's dead . That really desensitises you . Murder is a big fucking deal . \" &lt;p&gt; I personally do n't just kill people in games all day , and yes I know that even if I do that murder is a very different thing . I do agree with the concept of this game , to bring sex and drugs into the light that violence has been for quite some time , but making that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be negative side affects for the character 's abuse of drugs and casual sex ? Probably not . And how is someone being ' knocked unconscious ' that much better than them being dead . What 's the logic here , murder is a horrible thing , but beating someone senseless till they ca n't move is ok ? I mean sure they could have brain damage , internal bleeding , could be drowning in their own blood , might end up paralyzed ... buts it ok , cause they 're not dead ! &lt;p&gt; Sorry for the rant , but I just really did n't like that part of what the guy said . Even so , I do agree with the idea of allowing sex and drugs into games as well as violence , I 'm an adult and have the right to see and play what I wish . &lt;h&gt; Trending Stories Right Now &lt;p&gt; Briefly .

Event promoters were told that they did not have the appropriate license . &lt;p&gt; With recent news of a gay wedding in China , and the opening of a government funded gay bar in the tourist town of Dali in southwestern Yunnan province , things were looking up for the Chinese gay community . The pageant had received widespread press both internationally and even in China 's government controlled media , and was being regarded as a sign of China 's growing tolerance of homosexuality . &lt;p&gt; The pageant was to have an underwear section , a fashion show segment and a Q&amp;amp;A round , with the winner going on to compete in the Worldwide Mr Gay pageant being held in Norway in February . &lt;p&gt; \" Police said we did n't have the proper licence , \" Ryan Dutcher , one of the event organisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't say I 'm very surprised ... Police came here just before the event . We did n't have any advance warning . \" &lt;p&gt; After the event was cancelled the 150 attendees wandered about the venue in confusion , as organisers dismantled their equipment . &lt;p&gt; Wei Xiaogang , 33 , one of the competition judges , told AFP : \" In my opinion , it had something to do with the issue of homosexuality . I feel very sad . I almost cried . \" &lt;p&gt; Homosexuality was legalised in China in 1997 and taken off the register of mental illnesses in 2001 . While there is a burgeoning gay scene in China 's major cities , it 's still a tough place to be gay . On top of the usual prejudices is China 's one-child policy , which puts extra pressure on children to marry . It is estimated that there are some 30 million gay people living in China , two-thirds of them male .</td>\n",

Stories <h> Local Real Estate <h> Subscribe Now <p> LISMORE has provided a refreshing welcome for hundreds of gay and lesbian tourists who took part in the Tropical Fruits festival . <p> More than two decades of colourful New Year 's Eve parties hosted by the Northern Rivers gay and lesbian community resulted in a highly polished affair this year , with every attendee calling it ' the best ever ' . <p> But the greatest joy was marvelling at a host city that did n't look sideways at the often outrageous characters that attended . <p> Brisbane drag queen Joshua Cavanagh , alias Penny Drops , was the volunteer co-ordinator for this year 's festival and had nothing but praise for Lismore . <p> A walk down Molesworth Street in all his colourful gear failed to attract much notice , which came as a surprise . <p> \" This town goes open arms for us and we go open arms for it , \" he said . \" The level of passion and growth and energy here you wo n't find in any capital city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coastal Castaways , said compared with the Mid-North Coast , where homosexuality was treated with horror , Lismore was a breath of fresh air . <p> \" Where we come from our lifestyle has been forced underground . That 's why we 're called the castaways , \" he said . \" People there are not as educated as the Lismore community . \" <p> Mr Power said the highlight of the Tropical Fruits party was the host of 70s and 80s retro groove from outrageous DJ Kitty Glitter . <p> For others it was the huge fireworks display , which culminated in a giant burst of light . <p> \" It was like a golden shower , \" said Brisbane party-goer Glenn Baylis . \" Actually , that 's not the best way to describe it . It was more like a golden chandelier . \" \n",

decision not to allow same-sex couples to adopt children . <p> While gay couples can adopt in some Australian states , the NSW Government says the issue is too complex and sensitive and it will not be changing the law , at least for now . <p> But the decision has renewed calls for a national approach to adoption . <p> A six-month parliamentary inquiry found allowing same-sex couples to adopt would be in the best interests of children . <p> Despite many children being cared for by same sex couples , the state Minister for Community Services , Linda Burney , says there is not enough community support to change the law . <p> \" What I am saying to those couples is this discussion needs to continue .

For example : I 've been known to press my bare bum up against the back window of a moving vehicle but only in salute to people I know . True story . <p> I 've had reason to ponder my sense of modesty recently due to the fact that fourteen weeks ago , I cranked one out ( read : had a baby ) . Since The Sprout 's birth , my level of self-consciousness when it comes to my breasts has diminished to the point of non-existence . And you know what ? I 've decided it 's a good thing . <p> When I was first learning to breastfeed in hospital I felt a bit weird about exposing my breastfeeding equipment to a complete stranger ( the midwife , not The Sprout ) , but by the time I 'd had practically every member of staff on duty manipulate my mammaries in the name of teaching me the right breastfeeding technique , I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite literally up for grabs . Seriously - if Gary from the cafeteria had told me he had a great way of avoiding cracked nipples there 's every chance that within seconds I would have been tops-off for a demonstration at the bain-marie . <p> While in hospital I spent literally hours with my chest exposed : learning to feed , actually feeding and then letting my fledgling feedbags recover from The Sprout 's wonderfully hearty appetite ( I learned that you apply a lanolin-based salve and then let them air-dry . Do n't tumble-dry them - they shrink ) . <p> I spent more time topless than a slapper at schoolies and it got to the point where I had to check myself before I set foot outside my hospital room lest I give any visitors in the corridor the impression that the dress code if you 've just had an emergency caesarean is \" semi-nude . \" <p> During The Sprout 's first weeks at home the trend continued . One day I looked through the shots on our digital camera and remarked to The Bloke that I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked why he had n't taken as many of me . He answered that it was because I constantly had my boobs out . When I responded that surely that made for golden photo opportunities his reply was : \" I do n't know - you do n't want too many heads in one shot . \" <p> Having achieved such a level of gay abandon when it comes to breastfeeding in hospital and at home , my challenge now is how best to approach breastfeeding in public . <p> After reading that one in four people surveyed in a 2009 Newspoll considered it \" unacceptable \" to breastfeed a baby in a restaurant or caf ? , I 'm not sure how I 'll tackle the situation if anyone has a problem with the fact that my cups runneth over and The Sprout gets a crack at them whenever she likes . <p> And have no doubt : people are n't shy about telling nursing mothers what they think . One of my dear friends was quick off the mark in the food court of a shopping plaza recently when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breastfeeding her baby in a public toilet : she challenged them to eat their lunch in there . <p> Never mind that thanks to anti-discrimination laws , breastfeeding in public is legal everywhere in Australia . Never mind that the woman making the suggestion had her own children in tow and regardless of whether or not she breastfed them , she would have known that when a baby 's hungry their need should be met . And never mind that my friend was making every effort to be discreet - it 's not like she was standing topless on a table outside Gloria Jean 's offering anyone who did n't get enough milk in their latte a free squirt . <p> The double standards when it comes to norgs are baffling : why is it okay for women to get the girls out in a low-cut outfit when they 're dressing to impress but apparently not as okay for them to expose just enough to feed their babies ? How can one of the most basic and natural human functions be considered titillating ? ( And whose idea was it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tit ? ' ) <p> At the pub for lunch on the weekend The Sprout demanded her version of a parma and pot , so after throwing one of her light cotton wraps over my shoulder to give us some privacy I whipped out a boob and obliged . In the packed beer garden , nobody batted an eyelid . Just as well : on the outside I projected serene nonchalance but on the inside I was steeling myself to glass anyone who complained . \n",
       "1349293     <h> Sex , Drugs , But No Violence : A Porn Game With A Message <p> Video game developer Andrew Hall makes no bones about his lifestyle or the game he helped make that revels in it . <p> \" I have consensual sex and I do drugs , \" he told Kotaku in a recent interview . \" I 've never killed anybody before . But in video games you just go kill people all day , it 's like nothing . Bam , that person 's dead . Bam , that person 's dead . That really desensitises you . Murder is a big fucking deal . \" <p> That 's why third-person action , triple-X sex game Bonetown does n't include any blood or even the ability to kill people , instead you knock people unconscious during combat . <p> Hall , CEO of game developer D-Dub Software , sees the video game industry 's willingness to allow graphic violence controlled by gamers , but its refusal to include sex or overt drug references as hypocrisy . <p> He knows that Bonetown , a cartoonish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost non-stop drug use , wo n't change that , but he hopes it will help create a business model for other sex games that wo n't include having to go through the game industry to market and sell the title . <p> In the game , the player arrives in the fictitious Bonetown as man with no friends . The first woman that befriends him has sex with the player on the beach and \" shows you the way of Bonetown , \" Hall says . But then she gets arrested by \" The Man \" because they just passed the decency act in the town . <p> \" So The Man , who is pretty much corporate America and the video game industry , is trying to make Bonetown a decent place with no sex and drugs , \" Hall explains . \" You see The Man coming in and messing with Bonetown and then the last missions take you to The Man 's lair to stop The Man from moralising Bonetown and keeping from being the place where sex and drugs are free to be everywhere . \" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safely described in the context of an article that can be read at work or in the view of children . The PC game can be controlled with an Xbox controller and feels a bit like an open-world action game . While there are chapters that need to eventually be completed to finish the narrative of the story , players are able to freely roam around the game 's many different settings . <p> \" This is an adult game , but it 's not just about jerking off , \" Hall says , \" it 's about playing a video game too . \" <p> Players can approach any woman on the street and ask to have one of three types of sex with her . Her willingness to have sex will depend on the size of the character 's testicles , which are graphically represented by a cartoon in the top left corner of the game 's screen . A character can grow his testicles by having more and more sex or using some of the game 's many drugs . <p> The drugs in the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both give the player a temporary boost and provide them with a special attack that can be used against The Man 's agents that roam the city streets . <p> Hall said that the developers decided to give the game a cartoon look , because trying to make it photo-realistic would have lead to failure . <p> \" If you want to make a game about sex you could n't make the girls look realistic because there is that uncanny barrier , \" he said . \" Once you get so realistic it starts to get less realistic . So what we did , we tried to merge anime and Disney together . <p> \" Look at our girls , they have the big eyes , but it 's not the shroomed-out big anime eyes . And we had to go cartoon because we wanted our girls to be sexy . We wanted the Jessica Rabbit appeal of ' this is obviously a cartoon , but it 's still arousing to me ' . \" <p> Currently the game , which is packed with sexual positions and tons of graphic cartoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that will change . <p> \" Right now it is straight sex only , \" he said . \" The gay market is n't that big in video games . Gay men play video games , but we needed to hit the core market first , the 18 to 35 heterosexual males . We would love to expand to gay , we could add more sex positions too . \" <p> While sex and drugs play a big role in the game , comedy is also a chief element . <p> \" It 's really over-the-top comedy , \" Hall said . \" When it comes to the comedy South Park is our number one main influence . \" <p> The humour of the game is built into the combat , the character design and the levels , and is certainly helped along by the main character 's ability to assume the identity of anyone he defeats in combat . <p> For instance , Hall says , both \" White Jesus \" and \" Black Jesus \" are in the game . To prove it Hall ran his character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firmwood Forest \" where he found a laid back , meditative , pot-smoking Jesus hanging out at a campsite . <p> \" Jesus is chilling in the woods , \" Hall says as he approaches him . \" In Bonetown Jesus is a stoner . \" <p> Once Hall 's character lays into Jesus with a mannequin arm , the Jesus character starts to fight back with a cross yelling at the Hall 's character in a tirade that always ends in the word \" man . \" <p> After dancing around kegs of water and wine , and swatting at Jesus with the prosthetic , Hall finally knocks Jesus to the ground . Standing over him he presses a button and transforms . <p> \" Now I 'm Jesus , \" Hall says smiling . <p> Despite how adeptly Hall beat Jesus in combat , he says he does n't really play violent games . Well , maybe a few . <p> \" I play Grand Theft Auto because I think it 's funny , \" he says . \" I do n't like the new one The new Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you 're really a person in Liberty City and you 're really killing people , you know what I mean ? \" <p> Bonetown has plenty of weapons , Hall concedes , but none of them cause a character to bleed . <p> \" One thing , we did n't want was blood in the game , \" he said . \" We wanted to be able to have a little bit of moral standing against the video game industry , say , ' You guys in Grand Theft Auto get to go kill women and children and have blood everywhere . ' In our game all there is is consensual sex , there 's no rape , nothing like that , there 's no blood , you never kill anyone , you 're just knocking them out . <p> \" It 's consensual sex and drugs and is that really so much worse than killing people ? \" <p> More frustrating in my mind is the fact that there is very little separation between \" nudity \" and \" sexual content \" . <p> Are we that sexually stunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has the ability to do almost anything ( including graphically killing other people ) , we deem the sight of a naked body underneath armor and clothing to be vulgar and unnecessary ? <p> Sounds like a game that 'd never make it to Australia . Even with an R18+ and/or X18+ rating , the drug use would instantly place it as Refused Classification ( not to mention that it combines sex and violence ) . <p> I 'm really sick of comments like these \" But in video games you just go kill people all day , it 's like nothing . Bam , that person 's dead . Bam , that person 's dead . That really desensitises you . Murder is a big fucking deal . \" <p> I personally do n't just kill people in games all day , and yes I know that even if I do that murder is a very different thing . I do agree with the concept of this game , to bring sex and drugs into the light that violence has been for quite some time , but making that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there be negative side affects for the character 's abuse of drugs and casual sex ? Probably not . And how is someone being ' knocked unconscious ' that much better than them being dead . What 's the logic here , murder is a horrible thing , but beating someone senseless till they ca n't move is ok ? I mean sure they could have brain damage , internal bleeding , could be drowning in their own blood , might end up paralyzed ... buts it ok , cause they 're not dead ! <p> Sorry for the rant , but I just really did n't like that part of what the guy said . Even so , I do agree with the idea of allowing sex and drugs into games as well as violence , I 'm an adult and have the right to see and play what I wish . <h> Trending Stories Right Now <p> Briefly .

Beijing , was closed down by authorities an hour before it was to start . Event promoters were told that they did not have the appropriate license . <p> With recent news of a gay wedding in China , and the opening of a government funded gay bar in the tourist town of Dali in southwestern Yunnan province , things were looking up for the Chinese gay community . The pageant had received widespread press both internationally and even in China 's government controlled media , and was being regarded as a sign of China 's growing tolerance of homosexuality . <p> The pageant was to have an underwear section , a fashion show segment and a Q&amp;A round , with the winner going on to compete in the Worldwide Mr Gay pageant being held in Norway in February . <p> \" Police said we did n't have the proper licence , \" Ryan Dutcher , one of the event organisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't say I 'm very surprised ... Police came here just before the event . We did n't have any advance warning . \" <p> After the event was cancelled the 150 attendees wandered about the venue in confusion , as organisers dismantled their equipment . <p> Wei Xiaogang , 33 , one of the competition judges , told AFP : \" In my opinion , it had something to do with the issue of homosexuality . I feel very sad . I almost cried . \" <p> Homosexuality was legalised in China in 1997 and taken off the register of mental illnesses in 2001 . While there is a burgeoning gay scene in China 's major cities , it 's still a tough place to be gay . On top of the usual prejudices is China 's one-child policy , which puts extra pressure on children to marry . It is estimated that there are some 30 million gay people living in China , two-thirds of them male . "

       "      <td>Popular Stories  Local Real Estate  Subscribe Now  LISMORE has provided a refreshing welcome for hundreds of gay and lesbian tourists who took part in the Tropical Fruits festival .  More than two decades of colourful New Year 's Eve parties hosted by the Northern Rivers gay and lesbian community resulted in a highly polished affair this year , with every attendee calling it ' the best ever ' .  But the greatest joy was marvelling at a host city that did n't look sideways at the often outrageous characters that attended .  Brisbane drag queen Joshua Cavanagh , alias Penny Drops , was the volunteer co-ordinator for this year 's festival and had nothing but praise for Lismore .  A walk down Molesworth Street in all his colourful gear failed to attract much notice , which came as a surprise .  \" This town goes open arms for us and we go open arms for it , \" he said . \" The level of passion and growth and energy here you wo n't find in any capital city Coastal Castaways , said compared with the Mid-North Coast , where homosexuality was treated with horror , Lismore was a breath of fresh air .  \" Where we come from our lifestyle has been forced underground . That 's why we 're called the castaways , \" he said . \" People there are not as educated as the Lismore community . \"  Mr Power said the highlight of the Tropical Fruits party was the host of 70s and 80s retro groove from outrageous DJ Kitty Glitter .  For others it was the huge fireworks display , which culminated in a giant burst of light .  \" It was like a golden shower , \" said Brisbane party-goer Glenn Baylis . \" Actually , that 's not the best way to describe it . It was more like a golden chandelier . \"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Legal experts and human rights groups have slammed the New South Wales Government over its decision not to allow same-sex couples to adopt children .  While gay couples can adopt in some Australian states , the NSW Government says the issue is too complex and sensitive and it will not be changing the law , at least for now .  But the decision has renewed calls for a national approach to adoption .  A six-month parliamentary inquiry found allowing same-sex couples to adopt would be in the best interests of children .  Despite many children being cared for by same sex couples , the state Minister for Community Services , Linda Burney , says there is not enough community support to change the law .  \" What I am saying to those couples is this discussion needs to continue . At this stage we 're not pursuing legislation , \" Ms Burney said .  \" But I do want further discussion . I do want further community education and understanding around this issue , because at the end of the day , caring relationship and that 's what 's important . \"  There is a quirk in the law , however , as single gay men and women are allowed to adopt , and gay couples are allowed to foster children .  Kellie McDonald , the co-convenor of the NSW Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby , says adoption is the last piece of legislation in the state that still discriminates against same-sex couples and their families .  \" The primary concern should be what are the best interests of the children , and the Government has recognised that , \" she said .  \" It should n't be pandering to other groups ' opinions if they believe that these reforms would be in the best interest of the child . \"  Calls for national approach  A leading human rights and anti-discrimination lawyer , Wayne Morgan , says there are human rights attached to family life .  \" This is set out in a number of international covenants , in the human rights legislation that we have in some states and territories in Australia , \" not have two legally recognised parents , so I would say this adoption rights issue is a human rights issue .  \" Not in and of itself , but in terms of the human right to a family and in terms of the best interests of the child . \"  Mr Morgan dismisses the suggestion the NSW community is not ready for same-sex adoption .  \" Surveys reflect that the average Australian thinks gay men and lesbians should be allowed to marry , to adopt , indeed , be allowed to make use of artificial reproductive technologies to have their own children , \" he said .  \" So given that level of acceptance in the community , this scaring of horses , I would ask , well , what horses are we scaring ?  \" I would challenge the NSW Government , or any government , to put forward a valid , rational reason as to why the reforms should not go ahead . \"  There are now growing calls for the Federal Government to take over adoption laws .  A spokesman for there is inconsistency across the country because there is adoption protection in Tasmania , the ACT and Western Australia .  \" Victoria and NSW have this as a live issue by referring it for a national approach , \" Mr Irlam said .  \" But from a child 's perspective , it should n't matter which state they live in , they should be entitled to a loving and legal recognition of two parents . \"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Titillating talk  I would n't call myself an exhibitionist but I 'm not exactly a prude , either . For example : I 've been known to press my bare bum up against the back window of a moving vehicle but only in salute to people I know . True story .  I 've had reason to ponder my sense of modesty recently due to the fact that fourteen weeks ago , I cranked one out ( read : had a baby ) . Since The Sprout 's birth , my level of self-consciousness when it comes to my breasts has diminished to the point of non-existence . And you know what ? I 've decided it 's a good thing .  When I was first learning to breastfeed in hospital I felt a bit weird about exposing my breastfeeding equipment to a complete stranger ( the midwife , not The Sprout ) , but by the time I 'd had practically every member of staff on duty manipulate my mammaries in the name of teaching me the right breastfeeding technique , I just quite literally up for grabs . Seriously - if Gary from the cafeteria had told me he had a great way of avoiding cracked nipples there 's every chance that within seconds I would have been tops-off for a demonstration at the bain-marie .  While in hospital I spent literally hours with my chest exposed : learning to feed , actually feeding and then letting my fledgling feedbags recover from The Sprout 's wonderfully hearty appetite ( I learned that you apply a lanolin-based salve and then let them air-dry . Do n't tumble-dry them - they shrink ) .  I spent more time topless than a slapper at schoolies and it got to the point where I had to check myself before I set foot outside my hospital room lest I give any visitors in the corridor the impression that the dress code if you 've just had an emergency caesarean is \" semi-nude . \"  During The Sprout 's first weeks at home the trend continued . One day I looked through the shots on our digital camera and remarked to The Bloke that I 'd asked why he had n't taken as many of me . He answered that it was because I constantly had my boobs out . When I responded that surely that made for golden photo opportunities his reply was : \" I do n't know - you do n't want too many heads in one shot . \"  Having achieved such a level of gay abandon when it comes to breastfeeding in hospital and at home , my challenge now is how best to approach breastfeeding in public .  After reading that one in four people surveyed in a 2009 Newspoll considered it \" unacceptable \" to breastfeed a baby in a restaurant or caf ? , I 'm not sure how I 'll tackle the situation if anyone has a problem with the fact that my cups runneth over and The Sprout gets a crack at them whenever she likes .  And have no doubt : people are n't shy about telling nursing mothers what they think . One of my dear friends was quick off the mark in the food court of a shopping plaza recently when breastfeeding her baby in a public toilet : she challenged them to eat their lunch in there .  Never mind that thanks to anti-discrimination laws , breastfeeding in public is legal everywhere in Australia . Never mind that the woman making the suggestion had her own children in tow and regardless of whether or not she breastfed them , she would have known that when a baby 's hungry their need should be met . And never mind that my friend was making every effort to be discreet - it 's not like she was standing topless on a table outside Gloria Jean 's offering anyone who did n't get enough milk in their latte a free squirt .  The double standards when it comes to norgs are baffling : why is it okay for women to get the girls out in a low-cut outfit when they 're dressing to impress but apparently not as okay for them to expose just enough to feed their babies ? How can one of the most basic and natural human functions be considered titillating ? ( And whose idea was it for tit ? ' )  At the pub for lunch on the weekend The Sprout demanded her version of a parma and pot , so after throwing one of her light cotton wraps over my shoulder to give us some privacy I whipped out a boob and obliged . In the packed beer garden , nobody batted an eyelid . Just as well : on the outside I projected serene nonchalance but on the inside I was steeling myself to glass anyone who complained .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Sex , Drugs , But No Violence : A Porn Game With A Message  Video game developer Andrew Hall makes no bones about his lifestyle or the game he helped make that revels in it .  \" I have consensual sex and I do drugs , \" he told Kotaku in a recent interview . \" I 've never killed anybody before . But in video games you just go kill people all day , it 's like nothing . Bam , that person 's dead . Bam , that person 's dead . That really desensitises you . Murder is a big fucking deal . \"  That 's why third-person action , triple-X sex game Bonetown does n't include any blood or even the ability to kill people , instead you knock people unconscious during combat .  Hall , CEO of game developer D-Dub Software , sees the video game industry 's willingness to allow graphic violence controlled by gamers , but its refusal to include sex or overt drug references as hypocrisy .  He knows that Bonetown , a cartoonish almost non-stop drug use , wo n't change that , but he hopes it will help create a business model for other sex games that wo n't include having to go through the game industry to market and sell the title .  In the game , the player arrives in the fictitious Bonetown as man with no friends . The first woman that befriends him has sex with the player on the beach and \" shows you the way of Bonetown , \" Hall says . But then she gets arrested by \" The Man \" because they just passed the decency act in the town .  \" So The Man , who is pretty much corporate America and the video game industry , is trying to make Bonetown a decent place with no sex and drugs , \" Hall explains . \" You see The Man coming in and messing with Bonetown and then the last missions take you to The Man 's lair to stop The Man from moralising Bonetown and keeping from being the place where sex and drugs are free to be everywhere . \" be safely described in the context of an article that can be read at work or in the view of children . The PC game can be controlled with an Xbox controller and feels a bit like an open-world action game . While there are chapters that need to eventually be completed to finish the narrative of the story , players are able to freely roam around the game 's many different settings .  \" This is an adult game , but it 's not just about jerking off , \" Hall says , \" it 's about playing a video game too . \"  Players can approach any woman on the street and ask to have one of three types of sex with her . Her willingness to have sex will depend on the size of the character 's testicles , which are graphically represented by a cartoon in the top left corner of the game 's screen . A character can grow his testicles by having more and more sex or using some of the game 's many drugs .  The drugs in the game , both give the player a temporary boost and provide them with a special attack that can be used against The Man 's agents that roam the city streets .  Hall said that the developers decided to give the game a cartoon look , because trying to make it photo-realistic would have lead to failure .  \" If you want to make a game about sex you could n't make the girls look realistic because there is that uncanny barrier , \" he said . \" Once you get so realistic it starts to get less realistic . So what we did , we tried to merge anime and Disney together .  \" Look at our girls , they have the big eyes , but it 's not the shroomed-out big anime eyes . And we had to go cartoon because we wanted our girls to be sexy . We wanted the Jessica Rabbit appeal of ' this is obviously a cartoon , but it 's still arousing to me ' . \"  Currently the game , which is packed with sexual positions and tons of graphic cartoon but that will change .  \" Right now it is straight sex only , \" he said . \" The gay market is n't that big in video games . Gay men play video games , but we needed to hit the core market first , the 18 to 35 heterosexual males . We would love to expand to gay , we could add more sex positions too . \"  While sex and drugs play a big role in the game , comedy is also a chief element .  \" It 's really over-the-top comedy , \" Hall said . \" When it comes to the comedy South Park is our number one main influence . \"  The humour of the game is built into the combat , the character design and the levels , and is certainly helped along by the main character 's ability to assume the identity of anyone he defeats in combat .  For instance , Hall says , both \" White Jesus \" and \" Black Jesus \" are in the game . To prove it Hall ran his character , Firmwood Forest \" where he found a laid back , meditative , pot-smoking Jesus hanging out at a campsite .  \" Jesus is chilling in the woods , \" Hall says as he approaches him . \" In Bonetown Jesus is a stoner . \"  Once Hall 's character lays into Jesus with a mannequin arm , the Jesus character starts to fight back with a cross yelling at the Hall 's character in a tirade that always ends in the word \" man . \"  After dancing around kegs of water and wine , and swatting at Jesus with the prosthetic , Hall finally knocks Jesus to the ground . Standing over him he presses a button and transforms .  \" Now I 'm Jesus , \" Hall says smiling .  Despite how adeptly Hall beat Jesus in combat , he says he does n't really play violent games . Well , maybe a few .  \" I play Grand Theft Auto because I think it 's funny , \" he says . \" I do n't like the new one The new Grand like you 're really a person in Liberty City and you 're really killing people , you know what I mean ? \"  Bonetown has plenty of weapons , Hall concedes , but none of them cause a character to bleed .  \" One thing , we did n't want was blood in the game , \" he said . \" We wanted to be able to have a little bit of moral standing against the video game industry , say , ' You guys in Grand Theft Auto get to go kill women and children and have blood everywhere . ' In our game all there is is consensual sex , there 's no rape , nothing like that , there 's no blood , you never kill anyone , you 're just knocking them out .  \" It 's consensual sex and drugs and is that really so much worse than killing people ? \"  More frustrating in my mind is the fact that there is very little separation between \" nudity \" and \" sexual content \" .  Are we that sexually stunted one has the ability to do almost anything ( including graphically killing other people ) , we deem the sight of a naked body underneath armor and clothing to be vulgar and unnecessary ?  Sounds like a game that 'd never make it to Australia . Even with an R18+ and/or X18+ rating , the drug use would instantly place it as Refused Classification ( not to mention that it combines sex and violence ) .  I 'm really sick of comments like these \" But in video games you just go kill people all day , it 's like nothing . Bam , that person 's dead . Bam , that person 's dead . That really desensitises you . Murder is a big fucking deal . \"  I personally do n't just kill people in games all day , and yes I know that even if I do that murder is a very different thing . I do agree with the concept of this game , to bring sex and drugs into the light that violence has been for quite some time , but making that there be negative side affects for the character 's abuse of drugs and casual sex ? Probably not . And how is someone being ' knocked unconscious ' that much better than them being dead . What 's the logic here , murder is a horrible thing , but beating someone senseless till they ca n't move is ok ? I mean sure they could have brain damage , internal bleeding , could be drowning in their own blood , might end up paralyzed ... buts it ok , cause they 're not dead !  Sorry for the rant , but I just really did n't like that part of what the guy said . Even so , I do agree with the idea of allowing sex and drugs into games as well as violence , I 'm an adult and have the right to see and play what I wish .  Trending Stories Right Now  Briefly .

       "      <td>About the Author  Mr Gay China Pageant Shut DownBy Police  The first Mr Gay China contest , set to take place last Friday in Beijing , was closed down by authorities an hour before it was to start . Event promoters were told that they did not have the appropriate license .  With recent news of a gay wedding in China , and the opening of a government funded gay bar in the tourist town of Dali in southwestern Yunnan province , things were looking up for the Chinese gay community . The pageant had received widespread press both internationally and even in China 's government controlled media , and was being regarded as a sign of China 's growing tolerance of homosexuality .  The pageant was to have an underwear section , a fashion show segment and a Q&amp;amp;A round , with the winner going on to compete in the Worldwide Mr Gay pageant being held in Norway in February .  \" Police said we did n't have the proper licence , \" Ryan Dutcher , one of the event organisers I ca n't say I 'm very surprised ... Police came here just before the event . We did n't have any advance warning . \"  After the event was cancelled the 150 attendees wandered about the venue in confusion , as organisers dismantled their equipment .  Wei Xiaogang , 33 , one of the competition judges , told AFP : \" In my opinion , it had something to do with the issue of homosexuality . I feel very sad . I almost cried . \"  Homosexuality was legalised in China in 1997 and taken off the register of mental illnesses in 2001 . While there is a burgeoning gay scene in China 's major cities , it 's still a tough place to be gay . On top of the usual prejudices is China 's one-child policy , which puts extra pressure on children to marry . It is estimated that there are some 30 million gay people living in China , two-thirds of them male .</td>\n",

LISMORE has provided a refreshing welcome for hundreds of gay and lesbian tourists who took part in the Tropical Fruits festival .  More than two decades of colourful New Year 's Eve parties hosted by the Northern Rivers gay and lesbian community resulted in a highly polished affair this year , with every attendee calling it ' the best ever ' .  But the greatest joy was marvelling at a host city that did n't look sideways at the often outrageous characters that attended .  Brisbane drag queen Joshua Cavanagh , alias Penny Drops , was the volunteer co-ordinator for this year 's festival and had nothing but praise for Lismore .  A walk down Molesworth Street in all his colourful gear failed to attract much notice , which came as a surprise .  \" This town goes open arms for us and we go open arms for it , \" he said . \" The level of passion and growth and energy here you wo n't find in any capital city Coastal Castaways , said compared with the Mid-North Coast , where homosexuality was treated with horror , Lismore was a breath of fresh air .  \" Where we come from our lifestyle has been forced underground . That 's why we 're called the castaways , \" he said . \" People there are not as educated as the Lismore community . \"  Mr Power said the highlight of the Tropical Fruits party was the host of 70s and 80s retro groove from outrageous DJ Kitty Glitter .  For others it was the huge fireworks display , which culminated in a giant burst of light .  \" It was like a golden shower , \" said Brisbane party-goer Glenn Baylis . \" Actually , that 's not the best way to describe it . It was more like a golden chandelier . \" \n",

                                                                                                                                              Legal experts and human rights groups have slammed the New South Wales Government over its decision not to allow same-sex couples to adopt children .  While gay couples can adopt in some Australian states , the NSW Government says the issue is too complex and sensitive and it will not be changing the law , at least for now .  But the decision has renewed calls for a national approach to adoption .  A six-month parliamentary inquiry found allowing same-sex couples to adopt would be in the best interests of children .  Despite many children being cared for by same sex couples , the state Minister for Community Services , Linda Burney , says there is not enough community support to change the law .  \" What I am saying to those couples is this discussion needs to continue . At this stage we 're not pursuing legislation , \" Ms Burney said .  \" But I do want further discussion . I do want further community education and understanding around this issue , because at the end of the day , caring relationship and that 's what 's important . \"  There is a quirk in the law , however , as single gay men and women are allowed to adopt , and gay couples are allowed to foster children .  Kellie McDonald , the co-convenor of the NSW Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby , says adoption is the last piece of legislation in the state that still discriminates against same-sex couples and their families .  \" The primary concern should be what are the best interests of the children , and the Government has recognised that , \" she said .  \" It should n't be pandering to other groups ' opinions if they believe that these reforms would be in the best interest of the child . \"  Calls for national approach  A leading human rights and anti-discrimination lawyer , Wayne Morgan , says there are human rights attached to family life .  \" This is set out in a number of international covenants , in the human rights legislation that we have in some states and territories in Australia , \" not have two legally recognised parents , so I would say this adoption rights issue is a human rights issue .  \" Not in and of itself , but in terms of the human right to a family and in terms of the best interests of the child . \"  Mr Morgan dismisses the suggestion the NSW community is not ready for same-sex adoption .  \" Surveys reflect that the average Australian thinks gay men and lesbians should be allowed to marry , to adopt , indeed , be allowed to make use of artificial reproductive technologies to have their own children , \" he said .  \" So given that level of acceptance in the community , this scaring of horses , I would ask , well , what horses are we scaring ?  \" I would challenge the NSW Government , or any government , to put forward a valid , rational reason as to why the reforms should not go ahead . \"  There are now growing calls for the Federal Government to take over adoption laws .  A spokesman for there is inconsistency across the country because there is adoption protection in Tasmania , the ACT and Western Australia .  \" Victoria and NSW have this as a live issue by referring it for a national approach , \" Mr Irlam said .  \" But from a child 's perspective , it should n't matter which state they live in , they should be entitled to a loving and legal recognition of two parents . \" \n",

For example : I 've been known to press my bare bum up against the back window of a moving vehicle but only in salute to people I know . True story .  I 've had reason to ponder my sense of modesty recently due to the fact that fourteen weeks ago , I cranked one out ( read : had a baby ) . Since The Sprout 's birth , my level of self-consciousness when it comes to my breasts has diminished to the point of non-existence . And you know what ? I 've decided it 's a good thing .  When I was first learning to breastfeed in hospital I felt a bit weird about exposing my breastfeeding equipment to a complete stranger ( the midwife , not The Sprout ) , but by the time I 'd had practically every member of staff on duty manipulate my mammaries in the name of teaching me the right breastfeeding technique , I just quite literally up for grabs . Seriously - if Gary from the cafeteria had told me he had a great way of avoiding cracked nipples there 's every chance that within seconds I would have been tops-off for a demonstration at the bain-marie .  While in hospital I spent literally hours with my chest exposed : learning to feed , actually feeding and then letting my fledgling feedbags recover from The Sprout 's wonderfully hearty appetite ( I learned that you apply a lanolin-based salve and then let them air-dry . Do n't tumble-dry them - they shrink ) .  I spent more time topless than a slapper at schoolies and it got to the point where I had to check myself before I set foot outside my hospital room lest I give any visitors in the corridor the impression that the dress code if you 've just had an emergency caesarean is \" semi-nude . \"  During The Sprout 's first weeks at home the trend continued . One day I looked through the shots on our digital camera and remarked to The Bloke that I 'd asked why he had n't taken as many of me . He answered that it was because I constantly had my boobs out . When I responded that surely that made for golden photo opportunities his reply was : \" I do n't know - you do n't want too many heads in one shot . \"  Having achieved such a level of gay abandon when it comes to breastfeeding in hospital and at home , my challenge now is how best to approach breastfeeding in public .  After reading that one in four people surveyed in a 2009 Newspoll considered it \" unacceptable \" to breastfeed a baby in a restaurant or caf ? , I 'm not sure how I 'll tackle the situation if anyone has a problem with the fact that my cups runneth over and The Sprout gets a crack at them whenever she likes .  And have no doubt : people are n't shy about telling nursing mothers what they think . One of my dear friends was quick off the mark in the food court of a shopping plaza recently when breastfeeding her baby in a public toilet : she challenged them to eat their lunch in there .  Never mind that thanks to anti-discrimination laws , breastfeeding in public is legal everywhere in Australia . Never mind that the woman making the suggestion had her own children in tow and regardless of whether or not she breastfed them , she would have known that when a baby 's hungry their need should be met . And never mind that my friend was making every effort to be discreet - it 's not like she was standing topless on a table outside Gloria Jean 's offering anyone who did n't get enough milk in their latte a free squirt .  The double standards when it comes to norgs are baffling : why is it okay for women to get the girls out in a low-cut outfit when they 're dressing to impress but apparently not as okay for them to expose just enough to feed their babies ? How can one of the most basic and natural human functions be considered titillating ? ( And whose idea was it for tit ? ' )  At the pub for lunch on the weekend The Sprout demanded her version of a parma and pot , so after throwing one of her light cotton wraps over my shoulder to give us some privacy I whipped out a boob and obliged . In the packed beer garden , nobody batted an eyelid . Just as well : on the outside I projected serene nonchalance but on the inside I was steeling myself to glass anyone who complained . \n",
       "1349293      Sex , Drugs , But No Violence : A Porn Game With A Message  Video game developer Andrew Hall makes no bones about his lifestyle or the game he helped make that revels in it .  \" I have consensual sex and I do drugs , \" he told Kotaku in a recent interview . \" I 've never killed anybody before . But in video games you just go kill people all day , it 's like nothing . Bam , that person 's dead . Bam , that person 's dead . That really desensitises you . Murder is a big fucking deal . \"  That 's why third-person action , triple-X sex game Bonetown does n't include any blood or even the ability to kill people , instead you knock people unconscious during combat .  Hall , CEO of game developer D-Dub Software , sees the video game industry 's willingness to allow graphic violence controlled by gamers , but its refusal to include sex or overt drug references as hypocrisy .  He knows that Bonetown , a cartoonish almost non-stop drug use , wo n't change that , but he hopes it will help create a business model for other sex games that wo n't include having to go through the game industry to market and sell the title .  In the game , the player arrives in the fictitious Bonetown as man with no friends . The first woman that befriends him has sex with the player on the beach and \" shows you the way of Bonetown , \" Hall says . But then she gets arrested by \" The Man \" because they just passed the decency act in the town .  \" So The Man , who is pretty much corporate America and the video game industry , is trying to make Bonetown a decent place with no sex and drugs , \" Hall explains . \" You see The Man coming in and messing with Bonetown and then the last missions take you to The Man 's lair to stop The Man from moralising Bonetown and keeping from being the place where sex and drugs are free to be everywhere . \" be safely described in the context of an article that can be read at work or in the view of children . The PC game can be controlled with an Xbox controller and feels a bit like an open-world action game . While there are chapters that need to eventually be completed to finish the narrative of the story , players are able to freely roam around the game 's many different settings .  \" This is an adult game , but it 's not just about jerking off , \" Hall says , \" it 's about playing a video game too . \"  Players can approach any woman on the street and ask to have one of three types of sex with her . Her willingness to have sex will depend on the size of the character 's testicles , which are graphically represented by a cartoon in the top left corner of the game 's screen . A character can grow his testicles by having more and more sex or using some of the game 's many drugs .  The drugs in the game , both give the player a temporary boost and provide them with a special attack that can be used against The Man 's agents that roam the city streets .  Hall said that the developers decided to give the game a cartoon look , because trying to make it photo-realistic would have lead to failure .  \" If you want to make a game about sex you could n't make the girls look realistic because there is that uncanny barrier , \" he said . \" Once you get so realistic it starts to get less realistic . So what we did , we tried to merge anime and Disney together .  \" Look at our girls , they have the big eyes , but it 's not the shroomed-out big anime eyes . And we had to go cartoon because we wanted our girls to be sexy . We wanted the Jessica Rabbit appeal of ' this is obviously a cartoon , but it 's still arousing to me ' . \"  Currently the game , which is packed with sexual positions and tons of graphic cartoon but that will change .  \" Right now it is straight sex only , \" he said . \" The gay market is n't that big in video games . Gay men play video games , but we needed to hit the core market first , the 18 to 35 heterosexual males . We would love to expand to gay , we could add more sex positions too . \"  While sex and drugs play a big role in the game , comedy is also a chief element .  \" It 's really over-the-top comedy , \" Hall said . \" When it comes to the comedy South Park is our number one main influence . \"  The humour of the game is built into the combat , the character design and the levels , and is certainly helped along by the main character 's ability to assume the identity of anyone he defeats in combat .  For instance , Hall says , both \" White Jesus \" and \" Black Jesus \" are in the game . To prove it Hall ran his character , Firmwood Forest \" where he found a laid back , meditative , pot-smoking Jesus hanging out at a campsite .  \" Jesus is chilling in the woods , \" Hall says as he approaches him . \" In Bonetown Jesus is a stoner . \"  Once Hall 's character lays into Jesus with a mannequin arm , the Jesus character starts to fight back with a cross yelling at the Hall 's character in a tirade that always ends in the word \" man . \"  After dancing around kegs of water and wine , and swatting at Jesus with the prosthetic , Hall finally knocks Jesus to the ground . Standing over him he presses a button and transforms .  \" Now I 'm Jesus , \" Hall says smiling .  Despite how adeptly Hall beat Jesus in combat , he says he does n't really play violent games . Well , maybe a few .  \" I play Grand Theft Auto because I think it 's funny , \" he says . \" I do n't like the new one The new Grand like you 're really a person in Liberty City and you 're really killing people , you know what I mean ? \"  Bonetown has plenty of weapons , Hall concedes , but none of them cause a character to bleed .  \" One thing , we did n't want was blood in the game , \" he said . \" We wanted to be able to have a little bit of moral standing against the video game industry , say , ' You guys in Grand Theft Auto get to go kill women and children and have blood everywhere . ' In our game all there is is consensual sex , there 's no rape , nothing like that , there 's no blood , you never kill anyone , you 're just knocking them out .  \" It 's consensual sex and drugs and is that really so much worse than killing people ? \"  More frustrating in my mind is the fact that there is very little separation between \" nudity \" and \" sexual content \" .  Are we that sexually stunted one has the ability to do almost anything ( including graphically killing other people ) , we deem the sight of a naked body underneath armor and clothing to be vulgar and unnecessary ?  Sounds like a game that 'd never make it to Australia . Even with an R18+ and/or X18+ rating , the drug use would instantly place it as Refused Classification ( not to mention that it combines sex and violence ) .  I 'm really sick of comments like these \" But in video games you just go kill people all day , it 's like nothing . Bam , that person 's dead . Bam , that person 's dead . That really desensitises you . Murder is a big fucking deal . \"  I personally do n't just kill people in games all day , and yes I know that even if I do that murder is a very different thing . I do agree with the concept of this game , to bring sex and drugs into the light that violence has been for quite some time , but making that there be negative side affects for the character 's abuse of drugs and casual sex ? Probably not . And how is someone being ' knocked unconscious ' that much better than them being dead . What 's the logic here , murder is a horrible thing , but beating someone senseless till they ca n't move is ok ? I mean sure they could have brain damage , internal bleeding , could be drowning in their own blood , might end up paralyzed ... buts it ok , cause they 're not dead !  Sorry for the rant , but I just really did n't like that part of what the guy said . Even so , I do agree with the idea of allowing sex and drugs into games as well as violence , I 'm an adult and have the right to see and play what I wish .  Trending Stories Right Now  Briefly . Next year is Pok ? mon 's 20th anniversary . To mark the event , the card game 's first starter pack is getting a re-release . Originally , the and this reissue will be out next February in Japan for 1300 yen ( $14 ) .  Choice is the worst thing sometimes . What do I want to eat ? What would I like to watch that evening ? Often it 's usually too much choice , rather than having a choice at all , but sometimes picking between two things can be daunting . That certainly applies to developers and their future projects . what are they going to spend the next few years of their life building ? What do they like ? What do they think will be successful ?

                   About the Author  Mr Gay China Pageant Shut DownBy Police  The first Mr Gay China contest , set to take place last Friday in Beijing , was closed down by authorities an hour before it was to start . Event promoters were told that they did not have the appropriate license .  With recent news of a gay wedding in China , and the opening of a government funded gay bar in the tourist town of Dali in southwestern Yunnan province , things were looking up for the Chinese gay community . The pageant had received widespread press both internationally and even in China 's government controlled media , and was being regarded as a sign of China 's growing tolerance of homosexuality .  The pageant was to have an underwear section , a fashion show segment and a Q&amp;A round , with the winner going on to compete in the Worldwide Mr Gay pageant being held in Norway in February .  \" Police said we did n't have the proper licence , \" Ryan Dutcher , one of the event organisers I ca n't say I 'm very surprised ... Police came here just before the event . We did n't have any advance warning . \"  After the event was cancelled the 150 attendees wandered about the venue in confusion , as organisers dismantled their equipment .  Wei Xiaogang , 33 , one of the competition judges , told AFP : \" In my opinion , it had something to do with the issue of homosexuality . I feel very sad . I almost cried . \"  Homosexuality was legalised in China in 1997 and taken off the register of mental illnesses in 2001 . While there is a burgeoning gay scene in China 's major cities , it 's still a tough place to be gay . On top of the usual prejudices is China 's one-child policy , which puts extra pressure on children to marry . It is estimated that there are some 30 million gay people living in China , two-thirds of them male . "

       "      <td>Salem-News.com is an Independent Online Newsgroup in the United States , setting the standard for the future of News.Publisher:Bonnie **89;0;TOOLONG  Calling himself a \" conservative Catholic \" , Bacevich is a professor of history and international relations at Boston University and a retired Army colonel . He is the author of four other books , including The New American Militarism : How American are seduced by war .  Junk-oriented cavemen  I began my examination of American culture from an American point of view with a review of Vance Packard 's 1960 book The Waste Makers .  America 's current political , social , economic an military gridlock began on several levels in the 1950s . In 1960 Vance Packard wrote : \" The people of the United States are in a sense becoming a nation on a tiger . They must learn to consume more and more or , they are warned , their magnificent economic machine may turn and devour them . They must be induced to step up their individual consumption higher and higher , whether they have any pressing need it . \"  In 1955 , in The Journal of Retailing , Victor Lebow made an argument for \" forced consumption \" . \" Our enormously productive economy ... demands that we make consumption our way of life , that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals , that we seek our spiritual satisfactions , our ego satisfactions , in consumption .... We need things consumed , burned up , worn out , replaced , and discarded at an ever increasing rate . \"  In a letter to the editor of Product Engineering , in the 1950s a reader complained about planned obsolescence , writing : \" Let 's stop all this researching and developing for awhile ! We 're up to our glasses in ' progress ' now .... We are inundating ourselves with junk . Science devises junk ; industry mass produces it ; business peddles it ; advertising conditions our reflexes to reach for the big red box of it . To be sure , we are skilled junkmen -- but what of us ? How far have we advanced ? We are \" is a force-fed society with a vested interest in prodigality and with no end in sight to the need for ever-greater and more wasteful consumption . \"  \" The preoccupation with consumption is starting to make Americans look a bit fatuous in the eyes of the world \" said Packard . \" A few years ago , the Industrial designer Raymond Lowey commented that nothing about the appearance of the nation 's fat , gleaming automobiles ' offsets the impression that we must be a wasteful , swaggering , insensitive people . ' \"  In the last sentence of his book Packard says : \" The central challenge seems to be this : Americans must learn to live with their abundance without being forced to impoverish their spirit by being damned fools about it . \"  And , for the next 50 years most Americans continued to be \" damned fools \" . ( Let 's be clear about this statement . Most Americans are not fools , they just willingly let themselves be gulled . )  \" Even before 1950 , the United States had quantities were trifling . Over time , they grew . Here was the canary in the economic mineshaft . Yet for two decades no one paid it much attention , \" writes Bacevich . ( All unattributed quotes below are by Bacevich )  Packard noted that US oil consumption had tripled in the fifteen years since the end of WW II . \" With only one seventh proved reserves , the US is consuming more than half the world 's production . \"  In 2008 , \" while soldiers fought , people consumed . With the United States possessing less than 3 percent of the world 's known oil reserves and Americans burning one out of every four barrels of petroleum produced worldwide , oil imports reached 60 percent of daily national requirements and kept rising . \"  National Hypocrisy  \" The most significant moral characteristic of a nation is its hypocrisy . \" said the American philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr , a favorite of Bacevich , who adds : \" In international politics , the chief danger of hypocrisy is that it inhibits self-understanding . The hypocrite , George H. W. Bush said : \" The American way of life is not negotiable . \"  \" A 1996 UNICEF report estimated that up to half a million Iraqis had died as a result of the sanctions . Asked to comment , U. S. ambassador to the United Nations Madeline Albright did not even question the figure . Instead , she replied , \" I think this is a very hard choice , but the price -- we think the price is worth it . \"  \" Yet as long as Americans at home were experiencing a decade of plenty during the Clinton era , consumers enjoyed low gas prices and gorged themselves on cheap Asian imports -- the price that others might be paying did n't matter much . \"  A month after 9/11 Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said : \" We have two choices . Either we change the way we live , or we must change the way they live . We choose the latter . \"  \" As individuals , Americans never cease to expect more . As members of \"  \" Whether the issue at hand is oil , credit , or the availability of cheap consumer goods , we expect the world to accommodate the American way of life . \"  American way of life  \" For the majority of contemporary Americans , the essence of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness centers on a relentless personal quest to acquire , to consume , to indulge , and to shed whatever constraints might interfere with those endeavors . A bumper sticker , a sardonic motto , and a charge dating from the Age of Woodstock have recast the Jeffersonian trinity in modern vernacular : ' Whoever dies with the most toys wins ' ; ' Shop till you drop ' ; ' If it feels good , do it . ' \"  In December 2006 , President Bush noting that the holiday spending binge was off to \" a strong beginning \" , said to Americans : \" I encourage you all to go shopping more . \"  \" The ethic of self-gratification threatens the well-being of the United States . It mythical Puritan habits of hard work and self-abnegation , but because it saddles us with costly commitments abroad that we are increasingly ill-equipped to sustain while confronting us with dangers to which we have no ready response . As the prerequisites of the American way of life have grown , they have outstripped the means available to satisfy them . Americans of an earlier generation worried about bomber and missile gaps , both of which turned out to be fictitious . The present-day gap between requirements and the means available to satisfy those requirements is neither contrived nor imaginary . It is real and growing . This gap defines the crisis of American profligacy . \"  \" It would be misleading to suggest that every American has surrendered to this ethic of self-gratification . Resistance to its demands persists and takes many forms . Yet dissenters , intent on curbing the American penchant for consumption and self-indulgence , are fighting a rear-guard action , valiant perhaps but unlikely to reverse the tide . The ethic of self-gratification has firmly entrenched itself as the defining feature of the American of life this fact , but simply to acknowledge it . \"  The failure of the free press  This is where the so-called \" free press \" has failed , not just America , but the entire Western world . What happened is the \" free press \" served itself and its corporate masters , not the people of the United States . No one gave it a second thought because is n't that the way free enterprise is supposed to work ?  To borrow from the old cowboy ballad , from the 1950s until now , \" nary was heard , a discouraging word \" . The economic tsunami has been bearing down on America for sixty years and it has never been made an issue of national debate . Why should it have been ? The income of the MSM was primarily from advertising . They were equally dependent on the flow of cash coming from production , sales , and consumption of goods . Quarterly profit projections were the important things -- who cared about what might or might not happen ten or twenty years down the investment position of the United States turned negative as U. S. assets owned by foreigners exceeded the assets that Americans owned abroad . The imbalance has continued to grow ever since . Even as the United States began accumulating trillions of dollars of debt , the inclination of individual Americans to save began to disappear . For most of the postwar era , personal savings had averaged a robust 8-10 percent of disposable income . Simultaneously , consumer debt increased , so that by the end of the century household debt exceeded household income . \"  At this point it should have been declared a national emergency -- because it was ! \" Long accustomed to thinking of the United States as a superpower , Americans have yet to realize that they have forfeited command of their own destiny . \" ( my emphasis )  \" Others have described , dissected , and typically bemoaned the cultural -- and even moral -- implications of this development . Few have considered how an American preoccupation with ' more ' has affected U. S. relations with the rest of the world for consumption and self-indulgence are almost entirely negative . Over the past six decades , efforts to satisfy spiralling consumer demand have given birth to a condition of profound dependency . The United States may remain the mightiest power the world has ever seen , but the fact is that Americans are no longer masters of their own fate . \" ( my emphasis )  Founding Mythology  I 've argued before , that the Founding Fathers did not set out to establish democracy . Bacevich says the same thing . In 1776 . \" The hardheaded lawyers , merchants , farmers , and slaveholding plantation owners gathered in Philadelphia that summer did not set out to create a church . They founded a republic . Their purpose was not to save mankind . It was to ensure that people like themselves enjoyed unencumbered access to the Jeffersonian trinity . \" It had nothing to the do , except perhaps in passing , with the rights or welfare of woman , slaves , peasants , or the yeoman . We the People ... in this context means We the elite the existing system of government is not that it differs from what the authors of the Federalist Papers intended or from what elementary students learn about in social studies . The problem is that what we have does n't work . The gross incompetence of those who preside over the federal apparatus is appalling and unacceptable . Washington ought to symbolize enlightened governance . Instead , a system conceived ' to form a more perfect Union , establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquillity , provide for the common defense , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity ' poses a clear and present danger to those it was meant to serve . This is the political crisis confronting Americans today . \"  9/11  \" In 2001 , the Pentagon was prepared for any number of contingencies in the Balkans or Northeast Asia or the Persian Gulf . It was just not prepared to address threats to the eastern seaboard . Well-trained and equipped U. S. forces stood ready to defend Seoul or Riyadh ; Manhattan was left to fend for , these puerile expectations -- that armed force wielded by a strong-willed chief executive could do just about anything -- reached an apotheosis of sorts . Having manifestly failed to anticipate or prevent a devastating attack on American soil , President Bush proceeded to use his ensuring global war on terror as a pretext for advancing grandiose new military ambitions married to claims of unbounded executive authority -- all under the guise of keeping Americans ' safe ' . With the president denying any connection between the events of September 11 and past U. S. policies , his declaration of global war nipped in the bud whatever inclination the public might have entertained to reconsider those policies . In essence , Bush counted on war to both concentrate greater power in his own hands and to divert attention from the political , economic and cultural bind in which the United States found itself as a result of its own past behavior . \"  Bacevich is harsh in his judgement of the way 9/11 was handled .  \" Some mistakes , even honest ones can not be forgiven . The national security policy since 2002 extends orders of magnitude beyond inexcusable . \"  The last truthful president  We routinely believe that politicians lie . But not all do . In the 1950s , Senator Joseph S. Clark of Pennsylvania said : \" The goal of our economy is not the production of more consumer goods at all . The goal of our economy is to provide an environment in which every American family can have a good house for living and shelter , a good school to which to send the children , good transportation facilities and good opportunities for cultural and spiritual advancement . \"  His message was rejected by the American people .  In 1980 , running for re-election , Jimmy Carter tried to be straight :  \" In a nation that was proud of hard work , strong families , close-knit communities , and our faith in God , \" he said , \" too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption . Human identity is no longer defined by what one does , but by what one owns . does not satisfy our longing for meaning . We 've learned that piling up material goods can not fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose . \"  Ronald Reagan denied this thesis as he peddled his \" morning in America \" mythology to the American people who overwhelmingly voted for it .  Reagan was a \" faux-conservative \" who \" added to America 's civic religion two crucial beliefs : credit has no limits , and the bills will never come due . Balance the books , pay as you go , save for a rainy day -- Reagan 's abrogation of these ancient bits of folk wisdom did as much to recast America 's moral constitution as did sex , drugs and rock and roll . \"  \" During the Carter years , the federal deficit had averaged $54.5 billion annually . During the Reagan era , deficits skyrocketed , averaging $210.6 billion over the course of Reagan 's two terms in office . Overall federal spending nearly doubled , from $590.9 billion in 1980 to $1.14 trillion in 1989 . The federal swelling by nearly 5 percent while Reagan occupied the White House . Although his supporters had promised that he would shut down extraneous government programs and agencies , that turned out to be just so much hot air . \"  \" The Reagan Revolution over which he presided was never about fiscal responsibility or small government . The object of the exercise was to give the American people what they wanted , that being the essential precondition for winning reelection in 1984 and consolidating Republican control in Washington . Far more accurately than Jimmy Carter , Reagan understood what made Americans tick : They wanted self-gratification , not self-denial . Although always careful to embroider his speeches with inspirational homilies and testimonials to old-fashioned virtues , Reagan mainly indulged American self-indulgence \" .  Rethinking An American Future  \" For the abused wife , a condition of dependence condemns her to continuing torment . Salvation begins when she rejects that condition and asserts control over her life . Something of the same can be said of the American people .  \" For the United States the pursuit of has induced a condition of dependence -- on imported goods , on imported oil , and on credit . The chief desire of the American people , whether they admit it or not , is that nothing should disrupt their access to those goods , that oil and that credit . The chief aim of the U. S. government is to satisfy that desire , which it does in part through the distribution of largesse at home ( with Congress taking a leading role ) and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad ( largely the business of the executive branch ) .  \" From time to time , various public figures -- even presidents -- make the point that dependence may not be a good thing . Yet meaningful action to reduce this condition is notable by its absence . It 's not difficult to see why . The centers of authority within Washington -- above all the White House and the upper echelons of the national security state -- actually benefit from this dependency : It provides the source of status , power and prerogatives . actually to achieve anything approaching energy independence . U. S. Central Command would go out of business . Dozens of bases in and around the Middle East would close . The navy 's Fifth Fleet would stand down . Weapons contracts worth tens of billions would risk being cancelled .  \" So rather than addressing the problem of dependence , members of our political class seem hell-bent on exacerbating the problem . Rather than acknowledging that American power is not limitless , they pursue policies that actually accelerate the depletion of that power . Certainly , this has been the case since 9/11 . \"  \" Humility imposes an obligation of a different sort . It summons Americans to see themselves without blinders . The enemy of humility is sanctimony , which gives rise to the conviction that American values and beliefs are universal and that the nation itself serves providentially assigned purposes . This conviction finds expression in a determination to remake the world in what we imagine to be America 's image . \"  \" In contemporary American politics , appearances belie reality . Although the 's day , the actual system of governance conceived by the framers -- a federal republic deriving its authority from the people in which the central government exercises limited and specified powers -- no longer pertains . Citizens disgusted with what many see as a perpetual mess in Washington yearn for a restoration of a mythical Old Republic . Yet one might as well hope for the revival of the family farm or for physicians to resume making house calls . \"  \" It would be wrong to charge all the officials employed by these agencies State Department , the armed services , various intelligence agencies , the Joint Chiefs , Office of the Secretary of Defence , National Security Council and the FBI with engaging in a conscious effort to fleece or abuse the American people . Yet it would not be wrong to suggest that in an eagerness to advance institutional interests and protect institutional reputations trumps all other considerations and routinely provides the basis for behavior that is dishonest , unprofessional , unethical , and frequently at odds with the nation 's well-being . \"  \" each reinforcing the other -- no longer exists . If anything , the reverse is true : Expansionism squanders American wealth and power , while putting freedom at risk . As a consequence , the strategic tradition to which Jefferson and Polk , Lincoln and McKinley , TR and FDR all subscribed has been rendered not only obsolete but pernicious . \"  \" No doubt American economic and military power are substantial . Yet when considering the events of the past several years , above all the Iraq War , the president 's ' for us or against us ' ultimatum appears foolhardy in the extreme , and his promise to eliminate evil , manifestly absurd . His policies have done untold damage .... By overstating the Islamist danger , President Bush has committed the United States to a strategy of open-ended global war that can not succeed . Although the Bush administration and its supporters want us to believe that alternatives to waging global war do not exist , that is nonsense . \"  \" Rather than confronting this reality head-on , American grand strategy since the era George W. Bush , has been characterized by attempts to wish reality away . Policy makers have been engaged in a de facto Ponzi scheme intended to extend indefinitely the American line of credit . The fiasco of the Iraq War and the quasi-permanent U. S. occupation of Afghanistan illustrate the results and prefigure what is yet to come if the crisis of American profligacy continues unabated . \"  \" Rather than insisting that the world accommodate the United States , Americans need to reassert control over their own destiny , ending their condition of dependency and abandoning their imperial delusions . Of perhaps even greater difficulty , the combination of economic , political , and military crisis summons Americans to reexamine exactly what freedom entails . Soldiers can not accomplish these tasks , nor should we expect politicians to do so . The onus of responsibility falls squarely on citizens . \"  \" To persist in pretending that the United States is omnipotent is to exacerbate the problems that we face . The longer Americans ignore the implications of dependency and the longer policy makers nurture the pretense , the more precipitous will be its slide when the bills finally come due . \"  The American Military  \" A new national security consensus emerged based on the conviction that the United States military could dominate the planet as Reagan had proposed to dominate outer space . In Washington , confidence that a high-quality military establishment , dexterously employed , could enable the United States , always with high-minded intentions , to organize the world to its liking had essentially become self-evident . In this malignant expectation -- not in any of the conservative ideals for which he is retrospectively venerated -- lies the essence of the Reagan legacy . \"  \" America does n't need a bigger army . It needs a smaller -- that is , more modest -- foreign policy , one that assigns soldiers missions that are consistent with their capabilities . \"  \" Declaring that ' defense is not a budget item , ' Reagan severed the connection between military spending an all other fiscal or political considerations -- a proposition revived by George W. Bush after September 2001 . \" the United States is based on a simple premise : The United States does not start fights . We will never be an aggressor . We maintain our strength in order to deter and defend against aggression -- to preserve freedom and peace . Every item in our defense program -- our ships , our tanks , our planes , our funds for training and spare parts -- is intended for one all-important purpose : to keep the peace . \"  Today , says Bacevich : \" Despite Reagan 's assurances , by the end of the twentieth century , the United States did , in fact , ' start fights ' and seemed well on its way to making that something of a national specialty . \"  \" Even under the most optimistic scenario , Western forces will remain stuck in Afghanistan for many years , if not decades , to come . Although die-hard supporters of the global war on terror will insist otherwise , events in Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated definitively that further reliance on coercive methods will not enable the United States to achieve the Islamic world or subdue it , the military ' option ' is not the answer . \"  \" History has repeatedly demonstrated the irrationality of preventive war . If the world needed a further demonstration , President Bush provided it . Iraq shows us why the Bush Doctrine was a bad idea in the first place and why its abrogation has become essential . For principled guidance in determining when the use of force is appropriate , the country should conform to the Just War tradition -- not only because that tradition is consistent with our professed moral values , but also because its provisions provide an eminently useful guide for sound statecraft . \"  \" Many factors have contributed to the military crisis in which the United States finds itself today : greed , envy , miscalculation , ideological blinders , the nature of the international system , the sins of past generations coming due , the hubris of militarized citizens , the iron law of unintended consequences . But in American Soldier by General Tommy Franks we see on display one additional factor : an approach \"  \" SDI Reagan 's Strategic Defense Initiative prefigured the GWOT , both resting on the assumption that military power offered an antidote to the uncertainties and anxieties of living in a world not run entirely in accordance with American preferences . \"  \" The first lesson to be taken away from the Bush administration 's two military adventures is simply this : War today remains what it has always been -- elusive , untamed , costly , difficult to control , fraught with surprise , and sure to give rise to unexpected consequences . Only the truly demented with imagine otherwise . \"  \" The point of rehearsing this chronicle of misjudgement and miscalculation is simply this : The shortcomings evident in the way that General Tommy Franks planned and executed his two wars were hardly unique . They form part of a pattern . Time and again since the end of the Cold War , senior military officers shouldering the challenge of wartime command have been found wanting . \"  \" The quality of American generalship since the end of the Cold War has seldom U. S. forces may be at an all time high , the same can not be said of the most recent generation of four-star generals and admirals . This is one of those dirty little secrets to which the world 's only superpower has yet to own up . As the United States has come to rely ever more heavily on armed force to prop up its position of global preeminence , the quality of senior American military leadership has been consistently disappointing . The troops are ever willing , the technology remarkable , but first-rate generalship has been hard to come by . \"  \" To credit Reagan with having conceived a full-fledged Persian Gulf strategy would go to far . Indeed , his administration 's immediate response to various crises roiling the region produced a stew of incoherence . In Lebanon , he flung away the lives of 241 marines in a 1983 mission that still defies explanation . The alacrity with which he withdrew U. S. forces from Beirut after a suicide truck bomb had levelled a marine barracks there suggests that there really was no mission the measure of an army 's greatness , nor does fortitude , nor durability , nor technological sophistication . A great army is one that accomplishes its assigned mission . Since George W. Bush inaugurated his global war on terror , the armed forces of the United States have failed to meet that standard . \"  Bacevich on War  \" War 's essential nature is fixed , permanent , intractable , and irrepressible . War 's constant companions are uncertainty and risk . ' War is the realm of chance , ' wrote the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz nearly two centuries ago . ' No other human activity gives it greater scope : no other has such incessant dealings with this intruder , ' a judgement that the invention of the computer , the Internet , and precision-guided munitions has done nothing to overturn . ' The statesman who yields to war fever , ' Churchill correctly observed , ' is no longer the master of policy , but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events . ' Therefore , any notion that innovative techniques and new technologies whimsical . \"  \" When tested , the new American of Way of War yielded more glitter than gold . The generals and admirals who touted the wonders of full spectrum dominance were guilty of flagrant professional malpractice , if not outright fraud . To judge by the record of the past twenty year , U. S. forces win decisively only when the enemy obligingly fights on American terms -- and Saddam Hussein 's demise has drastically reduced the likelihood of finding such accommodating adversaries in the future . As for loose ends , from Somalia to the Balkans , from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf , they have been endemic . \"  Mythologies of America  \" Realism ... implies an obligation to see the world as it actually is , not as we might like it to be . The enemy of realism is hubris , which ... finds expression in an outsized confidence in the efficacy of American power as an instrument to reshape the global order .  \" America 's status as a force for good in a world that pits good against assassinating foreign leaders , overthrowing governments , and undertaking major military interventions . George W. Bush did not invent this practice ; he merely inherited and expanded upon it . \"  \" Crediting the United States with a ' great liberating tradition ' distorts the past and obscures the actual motive force behind American politics and U. S. foreign policy . It transforms history into a morality tale , thereby providing a rationale for dodging serious moral analysis . To insist that the liberation of others has never been more than an ancillary motive of U. S. policy is not cynicism ; it is a prerequisite to self-understanding .  \" If the young United States had a mission , it was not to liberate but to expand . ' Of course , ' declared Theodore Roosevelt in 1899 , as if explaining the self-evident to the obtuse , ' our whole national history has been one of expansion . ' TR spoke truthfully . The founders viewed stasis as tantamount to suicide . From the outset , Americans evinced a compulsion to acquire territory and extend their commercial reach On this point , the historical record leaves no room for debate : by any means necessary . Depending on the circumstances , the United States relied on diplomacy , hard bargaining , bluster , chicanery , intimidation , or naked coercion . We infiltrated land belonging to our neighbors and then brazenly proclaimed it our own . We harassed , filibustered , and , when the situation called for it , launched full-scale invasions . We engaged in ethic cleansing . At times , we insisted that treaties be considered sacrosanct . On other occasions , we blithely jettisoned solemn agreements that had outlived their usefulness .  \" As the methods employed varied , so too did the rationales offered to justify action . We touted our status as God 's new Chosen People , erecting a ' city upon a hill ' destined to illuminate the world . We acted at the behest of providential guidance or responded to the urgings of our ' manifest destiny ' . We declared our obligation to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ or to ' uplift little brown brother . ' responsibility to ' show the way to the nations of the world how they shall walk in the paths of liberty . ' Critics who derided these claims as bunkum -- the young Lincoln during the war with Mexico , Mark Twain after the imperial adventures of 1898 , Senator Robert La Follette amid ' the war to end all wars ' -- scored points but lost arguments . Periodically revised and refurbished , American exceptionalism ( which implied exceptional American prerogatives ) only gained greater currency . \"  The U.S. Government hijacked  I was aware many years ago that the \" arms race \" between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. was something trumped up on the American side , but Bacevich gives us the background and relevant details .  \" Today , everything about the national security state is gargantuan : its payroll , total budget , organizational complexity , appetite for information , ability to churn out reams of self-justifying press releases , and capacity for dissembling , chicanery and dirty tricks . The Pentagon alone houses a workforce of 25,000 employees , who each day while occupying 3,705,793 square feet of office space , traipsing over 17.5 miles of corridors , mounting 131 staircases , watching 4,200 clocks , drinking from 691 water fountains , and relieving themselves in 284 lavatories . \"  In early 1950 , Paul Nitze of the NSC prepared a secret report for President Truman and the NSC called NSC 68 in which American military buildup was the only realistic response to international communism . \" It also argued for higher taxes to make available the resources needed to fund rearmament . In effect , this ' Nitze doctrine ' offered a recipe for the permanent militarization of U. S. policy . \" ( my emphasis )  Most important , however , Nitze \" devised the technique of artfully designing ' options ' to yield precooked conclusions , thereby allowing the analyst to become the de facto decision maker . \" ( My emphasis . I think it is vitally important to recognize this usurpation of power in the chain of command . )  \" He showed how easily American ideals could be employed to camouflage American ambitions , expansionism . Above all , however , Nitze demonstrated the inestimable value of sowing panic as a means of driving the policy-making process . When it came to removing obstacles and loosening purse strings , the Nitze Doctrine worked wonders . \"  \" Even today , for neoconservatives like Max Boot , Thomas Donnelly , and Frederick Kagan , NSC 68 retains a talismanic significance , a model for what a ' coherent grand strategy ' ought to look like . According to Kagan , a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , Nitze 's handiwork offers ' a vision of the security policy America must pursue for as long as it is a global power . Yet what some see as coherence appears in another light as extreme agitation laced with paranoia , delusions of grandeur , and a cavalier disregard for empirical truth . To read NSC 68 today is to enter a hothouse of apprehension , dread and panic -- the same combination of emotions that helped facilitate the Iraq War with as little connection to reality . NSC 68 was an exercise in fearmongering , which Nitze 's day to the present . \"  \" No doubt today 's Wise Men see themselves as devoted patriots . No doubt they even mean well . Yet that 's not good enough . As Paul Wolfowitz himself wrote ; ' No U. S. president can justify a policy that fails to achieve its intended results by pointing to the purity and rectitude of his intentions . ' Much the same can be said of those who advise presidents and whose advice yields horrific consequences of the sort we have endured beginning on 9/11 and continuing ever since . They have forfeited any further claim to trust . \"  \" None of these , beginning with the NSC 68 's phantasmagoric description of Soviet capabilities and intentions in 1950 , turned out to be accurate . In each and every case , proponents of the Nitze Doctrine garbled the facts and magnified the danger . The bomber and missile gaps of the Eisenhower era were figments of overactive imaginations . Even as its nuclear arsenal grew in the 1960s and 1970s , the Soviet Union never achieved anything Rumsfeld Commission , its conclusions have proven entirely bogus . Yet in each of these cases , as with NSC 68 , the hue and cry concocted by Wise Men produced the intended result . \"  \" The Wise Men may not be overtly or consciously malevolent . To charge them with inventing threats out of whole cloth would be manifestly unfair . Yet from the era of Forrestal and Nitze to the present , they have repeatedly misconstrued and exaggerated existing threats , with perverse effects . \"  \" Yet if presidents have accrued too much power , if the Congress is feckless , if the national security bureaucracy is irretrievably broken , the American people have only themselves to blame . They have allowed their democracy to be hijacked . The hijackers will not voluntarily return what they have stolen . \"  Nuclear Weapons  \" Nuclear weapons are unusable . Their employment in any conceivable scenario would be a political and moral catastrophe . For the United States , they are becoming unnecessary , even as a deterrent . Certainly they are unlikely to dissuade -- Islamic extremists intent on acquiring their own nuclear capability .  \" For the United States , abolishing nuclear weapons ought to be an urgent national security priority . So too should preserving our planet . These are the meta challenges of our time . Addressing them promises to be the work of decades . Yet ridding the world of nuclear weapons is likely to prove far more plausible and achievable than ridding the world of evil . Transforming humankind 's relationship to the environment , which will affect the way people live their daily lives , can hardly prove more difficult than transforming the Greater Middle East , which requires the way a billion or more Muslims think . \"  \" By retaining a strategic arsenal in readiness ( and by insisting without qualification that the dropping of atomic bombs on two Japanese cities in 1945 was justified ) , the United States continues tacitly to sustain the view that nuclear weapons play a legitimate role in international politics -- this at a time when our own interests are best served by doing everything possible to reinforce the Thread of Hope  Although he is self-proclaimed conservative , Bacevich comes across as a genuinely human person ( I 've seen him speak in a video ) he makes one extremely telling comment : \" Pick the group : blacks , Jews , women , Asians , Hispanics , working stiffs , gays , the handicapped--in every case the impetus for providing to equal access to the rights guaranteed by the Constitution originated among pinks , lefties , liberals , and bleeding-heart fellow travelers . When it came to ensuring that every American should get a fair shake , the contribution of modern conservatism has been essentially nil . Had Martin Luther King counted on William F. Buckley and the National Review to take up the fight against racial segregation in the 1950s and 1960s , Jim Crow would still be alive and well . \"  A word from Benjamin Franklin  In a May 9 1754 newspaper Franklin produced this editorial cartoon . The object was to encourage the states to band together .  So it is today , but on a global scale . And the to decide to join the rest of the human race on the planet instead of staying with the pig-headed belief that everyone must fit them . We have and have had so-called Rogue States like Libya and North Korea , but after reading Bacevich 's analysis , it 's hard not to come to the conclusion that the United States is biggest Rogue State of all . And if the United States does n't reform it ways and attitudes , and that right smartly , then there 's only one thing left to say :  God help everyone else on the planet !  Personal Conclusion  Based on what Bacevich has said I believe that the future of America rests in the hands of the \" pinks , lefties , liberals , and bleeding-heart fellow travelers \" . They are the only group of people , despite their differing approaches , who want to drag the rest of American society , kicking and screaming , into the future and toward a better world for all .

       "      <td>The shooting took place at dawn on April 18 , but Davidson , a farmer and former school computer chief failed to notify authorities until about 8 p.m , after which officers found Wilson 's body in his own basement .  Four days after the incident , Davidson and his partner , Buck , were testifying in favor of legalizing homosexual marriage in Maine , an effort that ultimately failed . The pair proclaimed they \" were already married in the eyes of God . \"  According to the Record , which is published by the Civic League , \" Despite the sordid nature of the crime , reports published at the time portrayed Wilson and LaVallee-Davidson as innocent as choirboys . To date , there has been no mention in the mainstream press of what actually happened in the basement of Fred Wilson 's home in South Portland . Indeed , the mainstream press added to the confusion by reporting that the shooting was ' a kind of Russian Roulette ' gone wrong . \"  Indeed , coverage from the Portland Press-Herald shows asked if the homosexual pair were playing Russian Roulette when the .44 caliber handgun was fired .  \" Something along those lines , \" Stokes told the paper , refusing to be more specific about the evidence or circumstances .  \" There was handling of the gun throughout the evening , \" he said . \" It 's not clear how the gun got loaded . \"  \" Mr. Davidson pointed a gun at Mr. Wilson and deliberately pulled the trigger , not intending to kill . Believing a gun is not loaded is not enough in our view . It 's a deadly weapon . \"  Because of the victim 's connections to the homosexual bondage-and-discipline , sadomasochistic subculture and the location and time of the crime -- a Friday night in the basement of Wilson 's house -- it is almost certain that the shooter and the victim were engaged in debauchery during the evening , and that LaVallee-Davidson pulled the trigger in a drug and alcohol-induced stupor . This conjecture was confirmed by the unexpected revelation that Wilson was a member of Portland 's the practice of sadomasochism .  The Record went on to state that perhaps the most troubling aspect of the story was Davidson 's tearful performance at a public hearing as he lobbied for same-sex marriage just four days after he allegedly killed Wilson :  It is highly likely that individuals within the state government and the same-sex marriage movement knew of LaVallee-Davidson 's alleged involvement in the shooting , but took no measures to prevent him from testifying so prominently . In May , a source told the Record that the police who guarded the Civic Center during the hearing knew that LaVallee-Davidson had killed a man four days earlier . The Record subsequently began its own inquiry into finding out who in state government knew that an alleged killer was going to testify in favor of gay marriage .  In November , an attorney for Davidson suggested his client may have been suffering from AIDS-related dementia at the time of the shooting , thus clearing the way for a possible insansity defense .  Frank Lombard  Jury selection for Davidson 's trial is set to begin later in Cumberland County Superior Court in Portland .  This case of homosexual-related crimes being ignored by the national media is hardly unique .  In July , WND reported how news coverage of Duke University official Frank Lombard , accused of raping his adopted 5-year-old son and offering the child to someone else , omitted the fact that Lombard is a homosexual who lives with another \" gay \" man .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Eat , Pray , Love , Then Commit  Elizabeth Gilbert , famous fugitive from marriage , talks to fellow writer Ann Patchett about ' ' til death do us part '  By  Ann Patchett  Updated Jan. 2 , 2010 12:01 a.m . ET  Elizabeth Gilbert and I met several years ago when we spoke on a panel to a group of librarians , and what started off as mutual admiration quickly turned to friendship . Even though she lives in New Jersey and I live in Nashville we write massive letters back and forth ( the old-fashioned kind with envelopes and stamps ) and take any occasion we can to see one another . When I was recently speaking at a library in Connecticut , I flew up a night early and she borrowed an apartment from a friend who was out of town so we could meet up for dinner and have a slumber party with her dog , Rocky .  ENLARGE  Elizabeth Gilbert with her husband on her wedding day in February 2007  I was lucky enough : A Skeptic Makes Peace With Marriage , \" when it was still just a pile of paper , and not only did I read it , I had a hand in shaping the final product by insisting that she include the word \" pachyderm \" when discussing elephants . In doing so I left my mark on greatness . Multitaskers that we are , we also decided to write this interview in our pajamas on the couch , handing my computer back and forth and typing up our conversation about marriage ( I typed the questions , she typed the answers -- clearly she is the better typist ) . Her marriage is nearly two years old and mine is going on five . It turns out we had a lot to say .  Ann Patchett : So , Liz , is marriage going to survive ?  Elizabeth Gilbert : Marriage has a Darwinian ability to endure . It 's the most impressive thing I discovered about marriage . It alters itself however necessary to continue to be relevant and useful in people 's lives . It is . Marriage will be here long after humans are gone . What I came away from this book with was an unexpected and deep respect for marriage . People will always want intimacy with one chosen person and you can not have intimacy without privacy , which is why couples draw circles of privacy around themselves . They demand that family , neighbors and the law respect their union , and that is why we have marriage .  AP : What 's your view on having a range of options for marriage , going from a civil union to common law marriage to the Super Vows . I do n't think Super Vows ever got much traction .  EG : The Super Vows -- or what proponents call \" Covenant Marriage \" -- never got any traction . The idea was to offer couples an option : they could essentially choose between \" marriage lite , \" with an easy , no-fault divorce option , or \" marriage for life , \" the full handcuffs . Curiously enough , medieval Germans had the same package of options . Back -- given the choice -- select the lighter bond . Even in the heat of love , it 's as though we all understand that the future is a mystery , and it 's best to keep your options open , just in case , God forbid , it does n't last .  Journal Community  Also , as somebody who , in my second marriage , insisted on a prenuptial agreement , I can also testify that sometimes it is an act of love to chart the exit strategy before you enter the union , in order to make sure that not only you , but your partner as well , knows that there will be no World War III should hearts and minds , for any sad reason , change . As for the idea of creating such a thing as secular civil unions that would offer couples every legal advantage of marriage without using the language of marriage -- as they now do in Europe -- this makes perfect sense ... or rather , it would if we Americans did not happen to hold the concept of is , in this country , a civil union will always be seen as a badge of second-class citizenship .  AP : But then what 's the point of marriage ? Would n't it be more honorable , and more honest , to embrace the Northern European path and say , hey , we 're going to do our best to stay together for the family , even if we 're unmarried ? What is marriage if it is n't forever ? What then separates us from Britney Spears ?  EG : Oh , Ann , Ann , Ann . Please do n't force me to make a list of what separates me from Britney Spears . Marriage is a strange combination of dream and reality , and we spend our lives as couples trying to negotiate that divide . I will say this , because I think it is the single most important piece of information in the whole story : Marriage is not a game for the young . One lesson that Britney can teach us is : Do n't get married when you 're 20 years need to explain . Maturity brings -- among other things -- the ability to sustain and survive enormous contradictions and disappointments . Marriage is -- among other things -- a study in contradiction and disappointment , and inside that reality there is space for us to truly learn how to love . But it is wise to check at least a few of our most idealistic youthful dreams at the door before entering .  AP : Many people confuse weddings with marriage , or they do n't think past the wedding to the marriage . What are your feelings about weddings and how do they figure into the bigger picture of marriage ?  ENLARGE  Ann Patchett delivers a speech to the Clemson University incoming freshman class in Clemson , S.C. , August 2006 Associated Press  EG : I think this is a particular trap for women -- especially young women of the romantic variety , which is to say : young women . I myself have never been enchanted by the dream of the white wedding , and , heaven help us , the expectation that this of one 's life . But I did ask a number of my heartsick single female friends about this very question , and one of them gave me a truthful and illuminating answer : The fantasy of the wedding day is that it represents undeniable public and private truth that you have been chosen . For that one day , you are the most valuable creature in the world -- a treasure , a princess , a prize . For many women , who have never felt chosen or desirable or precious , this is an unshakable yearning . And I 'm afraid many women do choose the wedding over the marriage . It seems a steep price to pay , but it comes from a place of deep , sad longing to be loved and to have it proven that you are of value .  AP : Is there anything good about the public wedding ?  EG : Sorry ! Yes , of course . The gathering of family , obviously . The dancing is often fun . And one would have to be a troll not to of ceremony and ritual , which all humans crave and need : the public exchange of vows symbolizes for everyone within the tribe that the status of this couple has changed , that these two have made the transition into a new phase of life . I think all that is nice . What I object to is the hyper-fetishized wedding day , the prioritizing of wedding over marriage . Which is to say , I have a real problem with couples spending far more time discussing the seating arrangement or the color of the bridesmaid 's gowns than hashing out , for instance , their feelings about how they intend to handle questions of housework , child-rearing , finances and fidelity for the next four or five decades .  AP : How do you account for the falling rates of marriage in Europe ?  EG : Hmmm , very good question . I was hoping you did n't know about that . I thought we were talking about marriage in America .  AP : But your book is definitely not about marriage in America . It 's global marriage only so far as the information I discovered affected me when I encountered it , for instance when I met the Hmong personally . The book is about my efforts to find a small corner of the history of matrimony in which I would feel comfortable . So it 's mostly an American perspective because I 'm mostly an American . The Europeans do not share our innate cultural reverence for marriage , at least not the northern Europeans . The Portuguese still do . Here 's the thing : the unit of reverence in Europe is the family , which is why a child born today of unmarried parents in Sweden has a better chance of growing up in a house with both of his parents than a child born to a married couple in America . Here we revere the couple , there they revere the family . This is also why homosexuals in Europe have no comprehension of why homosexuals in America are fighting for the right to marry : They are perfectly happy to simply have equal civil rights , without the language of marriage mystical , intangible power : It is a passport to adulthood and respectability and to a certain extent citizenship . Any relationship less than \" married \" is considered temporary and not worthy of honor .  AP : Now that you 're married do you feel you 've been the recipient of all this gravity ?  EG : Yes . You do n't feel it or understand it until you have it . I moved to a small town in rural New Jersey with my husband and the very fact that I could introduce him as my \" husband \" -- rather than my boyfriend , or sweetheart or , God forbid , life partner -- meant that we were instantly trusted , instantly welcomed , instantly legitimized . Our marriage was a huge shortcut to social respectability , and there are countless tangible and intangible benefits of that . He and I are rebellious and stubborn enough that we would have foregone those benefits , but now that we have them , they lend us undeniable power .  AP : As someone who dated her husband for get married because I did n't want to take on the ease of that social acceptance or fall into the ruts of conformity in my relationship , I have to ask if you see any downside in all of this acceptance ?  EG : I think it 's unfortunate that there exists only one path in America to complete social legitimacy , and that is marriage . I think , for instance , that it would be far easier for Americans to elect a black president or a female president than an unmarried president . That would truly feel like cause for suspicion . Which means -- of course -- there is a massive pressure to apply this particular shape to one 's relationship . Which might explain why Americans marry more -- and , sadly , divorce more -- than anyone else in the industrialized world . So the downside is that there is a rush to the altar -- couples want to earn that badge of instant respect -- when they perhaps are unready , or not mature enough , to actually take on that commitment .  done and your book is written , what do you think actually constitutes the state of marriage ?  EG : Well , of course , this has changed over the centuries . In the ancient world , marriage was a tribal bond -- a means of legitimizing heirs and building family dynasties . In the medieval world , marriage was an economic bond -- a means of safely passing wealth from one generation to the next . During the height of the Catholic church 's power , marriage was a religious bond -- a lifelong , unbreakable contract to God , sealed by a priest . During the Industrial Revolution , with the rise of prosperity across the Western world , marriage finally gained the luxury of becoming a bond of love , an expression of individualistic choice . Today , marriage is a curious amalgam of all those things . Modern marriage is first and foremost a romantic and private union , but the tax laws and inheritance laws and religious implications that still surround this institution indicate that marriage has evolved without casting away its earlier purposes or this thing , piling new advancements on the old model . I think of modern marriage as a car strangely fashioned out of an old abandoned horse carriage , built upon the framework of a mule cart . All the original engineering is still there , underneath it all . Whether we are aware of it or not , we carry into our modern marriages the expectations and social memory of thousands of years of history , as well as our own set of newfangled tools that we use to tinker daily with the old machine . We alter and customize the thing every century , every generation , every day -- both in the courts and in our own homes . And marriage accepts our modifications gracefully . Marriage adapts , evolves and ( in a manner that I find miraculous and kind of inspiring ) somehow keeps chugging along .  -- Ann Patchett is the author of seven books , including the novel \" Bel Canto . \" Her most recent novel is \" Run . \" Elizabeth Gilbert is the author of \" Eat , Pray , Skeptic Makes Peace With Marriage . \"  This copy is for your personal , non-commercial use only .

       "      <td>But in his rollicking new book \" Star : How Warren Beatty Seduced America \" ( Simon &amp;amp; Schuster ) , biographer Peter Biskind hazards a guess about the conquests of Hollywood 's most notorious lothario -- based , he says , on \" simple arithmetic . \"  Biskind estimates \" 12,775 women , give or take , a figure that does not include daytime quickies , drive-bys , casual gropings , stolen kisses and so on . \"  As it turns out , the \" Bonnie and Clyde \" star was a late bloomer and did n't lose his virginity until he was almost 20 -- but he would make up for lost time in the decades to follow , bedding just about every woman on Hollywood 's ever-changing A-list , as well as any other woman who happened to , literally , cross paths with him .  Beatty has never been a kiss-and-tell guy , though . To the immense frustration of interviewers over the years , writes Biskind , \" even when he appears to be saying something , he is Hollywood writer , formed a surprising friendship with the actor -- and , at 72 , Beatty finally agreed to an authorized biography , dishing on his long list of leading ladies :  JANE FONDA  When a young Beatty auditioned for a teen movie , \" Parrish , \" in 1960 , his scene partner was a fresh-faced actress named Jane Fonda .  On the first take , Beatty gave her a brief , chaste kiss . \" I thought he was gay , \" Fonda tells Biskind . Director Joshua Logan was not having it . \" Look , are you afraid of Jane or something ? Grab her , boy , grab her . Do n't be shy . \" It was a directive that Beatty would apply to his love life forever after . \" Oh , my God . We kissed until we had practically eaten each other 's heads off , \" Beatty tells Biskind .  The two went on to become an item , and Beatty would later rave about Fonda 's sexual prowess \" due to her ability to virtually much larger than itself . \"  JOAN COLLINS  As Fonda remembers it , she and Beatty were dining at Beverly Hills restaurant La Scala when her boyfriend spotted British actress Joan Collins across the room . As Collins was moping about her fading affair with Cloris Leachman 's producer husband , she \" noticed the indecently pretty young man boldly eyeing her from a nearby table . He was 22 at the time , but he looked like he was barely old enough to drive . \"  Beatty dropped Fonda for Collins , and the two became an inseparable , insatiable couple . \" He made love to Joan Collins relentlessly , \" Biskind writes . \" But for Collins , it was too much of a good thing . One Sunday morning , exhausted , she stumbled out of bed . Dragging on a forbidden cigarette , she said , ' I do n't think I can last much longer . He never stops -- it must be all those vitamins he takes . . . In a few years , I 'll be worn out . had sex seven times a day . She replied , ' Maybe he did , but I just lay there . ' \"  SHIRLEY MacLAINE  Beatty 's older sister was an early contender for the role of Bonnie in \" Bonnie and Clyde \" -- that is , until her brother began to think about starring in the film as well as producing it .  \" With Beatty starring , MacLaine was out , \" Biskind writes . \" She quipped , ' That would be adding incest to injury . ' Beatty was unamused by her attempts at humor at his expense . As in , ' I 'd love to do a kissing scene with him , to see what all the fuss is about . . . I keep my daughter as far away from Warren as possible ! ' \"  JULIE CHRISTIE  When Beatty first spotted the gorgeous English actress , it was in 1965 , and she was an Oscar contender for her lead role in \" Darling . \" As actress Leslie Caron , another of Beatty 's longtime loves psychology . He always falls in love with girls who have won or been nominated for an Academy Award . \"  Beatty and Christie had a long , passionate , often turbulent relationship -- mostly due to Beatty 's chronic inability to be faithful . When he was shooting 1974 's \" The Parallax View , \" for example , his trailer had a steady stream of female admirers coming and going . An intern on the film recalled being surprised that \" some of the girls outside Beatty 's trailer who got past the door were not particularly attractive , especially since Julie Christie , who was doing ' Uncle Vanya ' on Broadway , was flying in to spend every weekend with him . Some were chubby , some had hints of mustaches on their upper lips . Some had the errant pimple or mole or other blemishes . \"  Beatty was an equal-opportunity seducer , Biskind writes , who would have sex at the drop of a hat and for an ever-expanding number of reasons . \" Late in 1971 , he implored singer-songwriter Carole King with him because , he explained , he 'd never been with a late-term woman and wanted to see what it was like . ( She refused . ) One night he got a phone call from a woman he did n't remember , who was married and lived in Colorado . She 'd had breast cancer and a mastectomy . Her husband did n't want to sleep with her anymore . Beatty was outraged , told her ' I 'd f- -- -- you in a second . Fly out here . ' \"  DIANE KEATON  In keeping with Caron 's Oscar scorecard , Beatty 's interest in actress Diane Keaton perked up right after she won Best Actress for 1977 's \" Annie Hall . \"  \" I was n't the Warren Beatty type , but there I was , \" Keaton tells Biskind . \" He was just so . . . overwhelming in every way . I remember looking at his face and going , ' How am I here with this ? ' The brilliance and the talent , you get caught up the role of Louise Bryant in Beatty 's film \" Reds , \" where his more controlling side came out during one audition , writes Biskind . \" George Plimpton , who was offered the part of a lecherous publisher in ' Reds ' after he literally tripped over Beatty asleep on the floor of the Playboy Mansion , auditioned for it by kissing Keaton with so much conviction that Beatty yelled , ' Stop it . ' \"  The combination of Beatty 's charm and his compulsive need to be in control would surface with many subsequent lovers -- such as actress Joyce Hyser , who ended up in therapy because of him .  \" Her therapist always told her that her relationship with Beatty was a mistake , \" Biskind writes . \" He would say , ' You got ta get outta there , you got ta break it off , it 's not right for you . ' Beatty , who was a therapy junkie , wanted to join her . She recalls , ' Within 10 minutes , Warren had completely taken over the Why do you feel you need to leave ? \" My therapist was totally in love with him . ' \"  FRAN DRESCHER  The nasal-voiced star of \" The Nanny \" read for a small role in Beatty 's famous 1987 flop , \" Ishtar , \" and recalls one colorful exchange with the actor , who was sleeping with the film 's star , Isabelle Adjani . \" He offered to introduce her to Adjani , saying , ' We were both talking about you while lying in bed last night . ' Adjani told her , ' You are very beautiful . ' But it was n't until Beatty added , ' We were both hoping you would like to join us for dinner this evening , just the three of us , ' that the flashbulb went off : ' I sure as hell knew a m ? nage- ? -troiserino when I saw one , ' she thought . \" Drescher turned down the offer .  JANICE DICKINSON  The wild-child supermodel ended up in Beatty 's hotel room and tells Biskind she went the middle of the night . \" I looked across the room and found him admiring himself in the mirror . . . In the morning , when I woke up , he was standing there again , playing with his hair , mussing it ; trying to get it just right -- going for that just-been-f- -- -ed look . \"  MADONNA  When Beatty cast Madonna in the role of Breathless Mahoney in 1990 's \" Dick Tracy , \" which he was both directing and starring in , he locked onto the pop star as his latest conquest . She turned out to be more than he bargained for .  Nightclub-loving Madonna would drag Beatty out to the gay discos with her , and try unsuccessfully to get him to dance ( \" Hey , P- -- -y Man , come on out here \" ) while pals like Sandra Bernhard hung around and made fun of him . \" We would taunt him , say things to make him uncomfortable . In a loving way . He was a perfect target , because he played ' ' Huh ? ' ' What 's all this craziness ? ' The whole relationship was a performance . \"  \" Beatty , a man who was accustomed to being worshipped by women , was on dangerous ground with Madonna , \" Biskind writes . \" Why he sat still for this kind of treatment remains a mystery . Chances are , he was taking his own advice . He would tell director Glenn Gordon Caron a few years later , ' Never , ever f- -- -- your leading lady . And if you do , do n't stop till the picture 's finished . ' \"  ANNETTE BENING  Barry Levinson 's 1991 movie \" Bugsy \" is probably best known as the movie that domesticated Warren Beatty . His first meeting with actress Annette Bening , who was vying for a role in the film , made an impression on \" Bugsy \" screenplay writer James Toback , now a director .  \" He let out this growl . . . A primordial yelp of love , lust , desire , enthusiasm , a at the prospect of finally being able to devour a huge and delicious meal . I realized that without question the role was already now settled , \" Toback tells the author .  The rest is history . How did Bening succeed in taming the actor where so many others had failed ? Beatty himself offered a possible explanation to a former girlfriend , actress Delaune Michel . \" I think back sometimes on a few of the women who were in my life before , the ones my mind naturally wanders to , the heavyweights , like you . I could have married any one of you and been happy . There is n't just one true love for anyone ; timing is everything . \"  ' I do n't think I can last much longer . He never stops -- it must be all those vitamins he takes . . . In a few years I 'll be worn out . '  -- Joan Collins  ' He let out this growl . . .

       "      <td>\" Thursdays with Abie \" / \" Field of Streams \" / \" Big Man on Hippocampus \" / \" Do n't Look a Smith Horse in the Mouth \"  I almost missed the return of the Fox animated bloc tonight because who programs the Sunday after New Year 's ? Is n't this the time when networks burn off shows and pretend that no one is watching them ? Maybe this is why Fox chose what ended up being a pretty weak slate of episodes to kick off the new year , four shows that never came together , with two of them being actively pretty bad . I enjoyed The Simpsons and American Dad to varying degrees , but The Cleveland Show and Family Guy both had their moments while still never coming together to make satisfying episodes . It 's a new year , and whether Fox just burned these episodes off or whatever , it 's time to take them to task ! Or talk generally about their disappointments and the histories of each shows , as it were .  The have hung on to their ability to move us . Most Homer and Lisa episodes are still touching on some level , while most Bart and Lisa episodes play off the two 's easy camaraderie . One of the exceptions to this rule is the relationship between Homer and his dad . The two had some great episodes in the show 's early going , as the series examined the way that Abe 's inability to be a good single parent reverberated down through the years ( in a much , much funnier way than that sounds ) . Episodes like \" Grampa vs . Sexual Inadequacy \" and \" Mother Simpson \" focused in on the way the seeming hatred Homer had for his dad was driven by something deeper , and they were weirdly emotionally resonant . But over the years , some of the spark has gone out of this relationship , as the show has mostly just turned to storylines where Homer realizes how lucky he is to have his dad . This was another one of those , as Grampa told some of his rambling stories by the guy , only to be saved by Homer at the last minute . The fact that The Simpsons endlessly resets itself does n't really hurt the relationships between the parents and their kids or between the siblings because those are the kinds of relationships that are always , essentially , resetting themselves , until adolescence starts to firm them up . That Homer and his dad ca n't come to any sort of movement forward feels forced , I think , and means these kinds of stories have to get more and more out there . On the other hand , I liked the Bart and Lisa B-plot , as the two tried to rescue the stuffed lamb Bart had brought home from school for the weekend ( even if its resolution was too quickly glossed over ) , and I laughed a handful of times , so let 's go with a Grade : C+  The Cleveland Show : Then there 's this , which I 've sort of been making excuses for for a while now because the show was in its first 13 episodes and where the stories of a family attempting to blend together would trump the often lame cutaway gags - that I would eventually come to appreciate . Instead , the show seems to take one or two steps forward and then many more steps back . So while I more or less enjoyed the Christmas episode , there was something I found boring about this one . Worse , I only laughed at it a few times ( mostly during the opening segment set during 1984 with all of the rampant 1984 references followed by Cleveland saying , \" It was 1984 \" ) . Theoretically , I should be enjoying something like Cleveland trying to bond with his son , but this storyline was so predictable and one note that I could n't even be amused by Cleveland , Jr. , who 's my favorite character , except when he was pretending to fly around like a butterfly . There are some good jokes around the edges of this episode , but overall , it 's got ta be considered a dud . Grade : C-  Family Guy : This The Family Feud riff was nicely elaborate and full of some nice little jokes ( I liked Meg 's suggestion of razors and a note being turned into \" Sundries \" on the big board ) , even if the Richard Dawson stuff was all about the easiest possible series of Richard Dawson jokes one could make . I even enjoyed the adult swim bumper cards runner that closed out the first act with the show mocking itself for doing an amnesia plotline . But from there , the episode just devolved into a fairly typical amnesia storyline , with Peter losing his memory and then getting it back and having to relearn being a family guy ( tee hee ) along the way . Naturally , this being Family Guy , he decided that being a bachelor was more fun , then had to save his wife from having sex with Quagmire . And the episode ended with Quagmire trying to use electroshock paddles to stimulate his penis . I mean , I get that Family Guy is never going to have storylines that are surprising in the least , use those storylines as a thin spine to hang jokes on , then the jokes should be funnier . They were n't tonight , and this was mostly a waste of a half hour , even as I think this season , overall , had been pretty good . Grade : D  American Dad : Here 's the opposite problem of Family Guy . I found the first two-thirds of this episode fairly listless , as the show wandered into commentary on the recession by showing how the Smiths were trying to cut back but Stan was still running his gas guzzling SUV . All of this led to Stan buying a horse but blowing way too much of the family 's savings on it , leading to Francine hating the horse and , also , just a little bit , Stan . Meanwhile , Steve and pals were trying to get a fat guy off of his bed , only to have one of them disappear beneath the fat guy . But the last third of the episode - featuring Klaus ' anger at not being put back into the solution to Steve 's problems - was actually quite funny , packing the most laughs of anything in the bloc for the evening . You often hear in articles about TV writers rooms about a big white board where possible plotlines are written down , just in case the writers run out of ideas for new episodes . I kind of wonder just how long \" Stan becomes a horse \" was written on the American Dad board , but there was something goofily charming about the way this all played out - much less the way that everything tied together in the end - that made the episode end on a high enough note for me to give it a Grade : B  Stray observations :  Next week is the big Simpsons anniversary thing . Naturally , I 'll write up the new episodes , but do you guys want coverage of the documentary special ? I come to serve , as the Elven Rangers used to say in Warcraft II . \" They 'll cheer a dancing octopus , but not an old man complaining about NONE of his courses . Please call me , BART 'S BIGGEST FAN . Edna Karbappel . \" \" You do n't get a beating like this riding in a plane . \" \" Ah ! Sewer cats ! \" \" He learned the lesson he learned 25 years ago : Mess with me , and you 're gon na pee on your thigh and pocket contents . \" \" Well , I 'll be a son of a bitch . \" \" What is it , dad ? \" \" It 's a HORSE , and it 's racing today . \" \" If you do n't stop doing that , I 'm gon na come to your house and kick your mom to death while you watch . \" \" It 's not perfect for me , Steve ! \" \" Why are we holding hands ? \" \" How else will people know we 're gay ? \"</td>\n",

He is the author of four other books , including The New American Militarism : How American are seduced by war .  Junk-oriented cavemen  I began my examination of American culture from an American point of view with a review of Vance Packard 's 1960 book The Waste Makers .  America 's current political , social , economic an military gridlock began on several levels in the 1950s . In 1960 Vance Packard wrote : \" The people of the United States are in a sense becoming a nation on a tiger . They must learn to consume more and more or , they are warned , their magnificent economic machine may turn and devour them . They must be induced to step up their individual consumption higher and higher , whether they have any pressing need it . \"  In 1955 , in The Journal of Retailing , Victor Lebow made an argument for \" forced consumption \" . \" Our enormously productive economy ... demands that we make consumption our way of life , that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals , that we seek our spiritual satisfactions , our ego satisfactions , in consumption .... We need things consumed , burned up , worn out , replaced , and discarded at an ever increasing rate . \"  In a letter to the editor of Product Engineering , in the 1950s a reader complained about planned obsolescence , writing : \" Let 's stop all this researching and developing for awhile ! We 're up to our glasses in ' progress ' now .... We are inundating ourselves with junk . Science devises junk ; industry mass produces it ; business peddles it ; advertising conditions our reflexes to reach for the big red box of it . To be sure , we are skilled junkmen -- but what of us ? How far have we advanced ? We are \" is a force-fed society with a vested interest in prodigality and with no end in sight to the need for ever-greater and more wasteful consumption . \"  \" The preoccupation with consumption is starting to make Americans look a bit fatuous in the eyes of the world \" said Packard . \" A few years ago , the Industrial designer Raymond Lowey commented that nothing about the appearance of the nation 's fat , gleaming automobiles ' offsets the impression that we must be a wasteful , swaggering , insensitive people . ' \"  In the last sentence of his book Packard says : \" The central challenge seems to be this : Americans must learn to live with their abundance without being forced to impoverish their spirit by being damned fools about it . \"  And , for the next 50 years most Americans continued to be \" damned fools \" . ( Let 's be clear about this statement . Most Americans are not fools , they just willingly let themselves be gulled . )  \" Even before 1950 , the United States had quantities were trifling . Over time , they grew . Here was the canary in the economic mineshaft . Yet for two decades no one paid it much attention , \" writes Bacevich . ( All unattributed quotes below are by Bacevich )  Packard noted that US oil consumption had tripled in the fifteen years since the end of WW II . \" With only one seventh proved reserves , the US is consuming more than half the world 's production . \"  In 2008 , \" while soldiers fought , people consumed . With the United States possessing less than 3 percent of the world 's known oil reserves and Americans burning one out of every four barrels of petroleum produced worldwide , oil imports reached 60 percent of daily national requirements and kept rising . \"  National Hypocrisy  \" The most significant moral characteristic of a nation is its hypocrisy . \" said the American philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr , a favorite of Bacevich , who adds : \" In international politics , the chief danger of hypocrisy is that it inhibits self-understanding . The hypocrite , George H. W. Bush said : \" The American way of life is not negotiable . \"  \" A 1996 UNICEF report estimated that up to half a million Iraqis had died as a result of the sanctions . Asked to comment , U. S. ambassador to the United Nations Madeline Albright did not even question the figure . Instead , she replied , \" I think this is a very hard choice , but the price -- we think the price is worth it . \"  \" Yet as long as Americans at home were experiencing a decade of plenty during the Clinton era , consumers enjoyed low gas prices and gorged themselves on cheap Asian imports -- the price that others might be paying did n't matter much . \"  A month after 9/11 Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said : \" We have two choices . Either we change the way we live , or we must change the way they live . We choose the latter . \"  \" As individuals , Americans never cease to expect more . As members of \"  \" Whether the issue at hand is oil , credit , or the availability of cheap consumer goods , we expect the world to accommodate the American way of life . \"  American way of life  \" For the majority of contemporary Americans , the essence of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness centers on a relentless personal quest to acquire , to consume , to indulge , and to shed whatever constraints might interfere with those endeavors . A bumper sticker , a sardonic motto , and a charge dating from the Age of Woodstock have recast the Jeffersonian trinity in modern vernacular : ' Whoever dies with the most toys wins ' ; ' Shop till you drop ' ; ' If it feels good , do it . ' \"  In December 2006 , President Bush noting that the holiday spending binge was off to \" a strong beginning \" , said to Americans : \" I encourage you all to go shopping more . \"  \" The ethic of self-gratification threatens the well-being of the United States . It mythical Puritan habits of hard work and self-abnegation , but because it saddles us with costly commitments abroad that we are increasingly ill-equipped to sustain while confronting us with dangers to which we have no ready response . As the prerequisites of the American way of life have grown , they have outstripped the means available to satisfy them . Americans of an earlier generation worried about bomber and missile gaps , both of which turned out to be fictitious . The present-day gap between requirements and the means available to satisfy those requirements is neither contrived nor imaginary . It is real and growing . This gap defines the crisis of American profligacy . \"  \" It would be misleading to suggest that every American has surrendered to this ethic of self-gratification . Resistance to its demands persists and takes many forms . Yet dissenters , intent on curbing the American penchant for consumption and self-indulgence , are fighting a rear-guard action , valiant perhaps but unlikely to reverse the tide . The ethic of self-gratification has firmly entrenched itself as the defining feature of the American of life this fact , but simply to acknowledge it . \"  The failure of the free press  This is where the so-called \" free press \" has failed , not just America , but the entire Western world . What happened is the \" free press \" served itself and its corporate masters , not the people of the United States . No one gave it a second thought because is n't that the way free enterprise is supposed to work ?  To borrow from the old cowboy ballad , from the 1950s until now , \" nary was heard , a discouraging word \" . The economic tsunami has been bearing down on America for sixty years and it has never been made an issue of national debate . Why should it have been ? The income of the MSM was primarily from advertising . They were equally dependent on the flow of cash coming from production , sales , and consumption of goods . Quarterly profit projections were the important things -- who cared about what might or might not happen ten or twenty years down the investment position of the United States turned negative as U. S. assets owned by foreigners exceeded the assets that Americans owned abroad . The imbalance has continued to grow ever since . Even as the United States began accumulating trillions of dollars of debt , the inclination of individual Americans to save began to disappear . For most of the postwar era , personal savings had averaged a robust 8-10 percent of disposable income . Simultaneously , consumer debt increased , so that by the end of the century household debt exceeded household income . \"  At this point it should have been declared a national emergency -- because it was ! \" Long accustomed to thinking of the United States as a superpower , Americans have yet to realize that they have forfeited command of their own destiny . \" ( my emphasis )  \" Others have described , dissected , and typically bemoaned the cultural -- and even moral -- implications of this development . Few have considered how an American preoccupation with ' more ' has affected U. S. relations with the rest of the world for consumption and self-indulgence are almost entirely negative . Over the past six decades , efforts to satisfy spiralling consumer demand have given birth to a condition of profound dependency . The United States may remain the mightiest power the world has ever seen , but the fact is that Americans are no longer masters of their own fate . \" ( my emphasis )  Founding Mythology  I 've argued before , that the Founding Fathers did not set out to establish democracy . Bacevich says the same thing . In 1776 . \" The hardheaded lawyers , merchants , farmers , and slaveholding plantation owners gathered in Philadelphia that summer did not set out to create a church . They founded a republic . Their purpose was not to save mankind . It was to ensure that people like themselves enjoyed unencumbered access to the Jeffersonian trinity . \" It had nothing to the do , except perhaps in passing , with the rights or welfare of woman , slaves , peasants , or the yeoman . We the People ... in this context means We the elite the existing system of government is not that it differs from what the authors of the Federalist Papers intended or from what elementary students learn about in social studies . The problem is that what we have does n't work . The gross incompetence of those who preside over the federal apparatus is appalling and unacceptable . Washington ought to symbolize enlightened governance . Instead , a system conceived ' to form a more perfect Union , establish Justice , insure domestic Tranquillity , provide for the common defense , promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity ' poses a clear and present danger to those it was meant to serve . This is the political crisis confronting Americans today . \"  9/11  \" In 2001 , the Pentagon was prepared for any number of contingencies in the Balkans or Northeast Asia or the Persian Gulf . It was just not prepared to address threats to the eastern seaboard . Well-trained and equipped U. S. forces stood ready to defend Seoul or Riyadh ; Manhattan was left to fend for , these puerile expectations -- that armed force wielded by a strong-willed chief executive could do just about anything -- reached an apotheosis of sorts . Having manifestly failed to anticipate or prevent a devastating attack on American soil , President Bush proceeded to use his ensuring global war on terror as a pretext for advancing grandiose new military ambitions married to claims of unbounded executive authority -- all under the guise of keeping Americans ' safe ' . With the president denying any connection between the events of September 11 and past U. S. policies , his declaration of global war nipped in the bud whatever inclination the public might have entertained to reconsider those policies . In essence , Bush counted on war to both concentrate greater power in his own hands and to divert attention from the political , economic and cultural bind in which the United States found itself as a result of its own past behavior . \"  Bacevich is harsh in his judgement of the way 9/11 was handled .  \" Some mistakes , even honest ones can not be forgiven . The national security policy since 2002 extends orders of magnitude beyond inexcusable . \"  The last truthful president  We routinely believe that politicians lie . But not all do . In the 1950s , Senator Joseph S. Clark of Pennsylvania said : \" The goal of our economy is not the production of more consumer goods at all . The goal of our economy is to provide an environment in which every American family can have a good house for living and shelter , a good school to which to send the children , good transportation facilities and good opportunities for cultural and spiritual advancement . \"  His message was rejected by the American people .  In 1980 , running for re-election , Jimmy Carter tried to be straight :  \" In a nation that was proud of hard work , strong families , close-knit communities , and our faith in God , \" he said , \" too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption . Human identity is no longer defined by what one does , but by what one owns . does not satisfy our longing for meaning . We 've learned that piling up material goods can not fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose . \"  Ronald Reagan denied this thesis as he peddled his \" morning in America \" mythology to the American people who overwhelmingly voted for it .  Reagan was a \" faux-conservative \" who \" added to America 's civic religion two crucial beliefs : credit has no limits , and the bills will never come due . Balance the books , pay as you go , save for a rainy day -- Reagan 's abrogation of these ancient bits of folk wisdom did as much to recast America 's moral constitution as did sex , drugs and rock and roll . \"  \" During the Carter years , the federal deficit had averaged $54.5 billion annually . During the Reagan era , deficits skyrocketed , averaging $210.6 billion over the course of Reagan 's two terms in office . Overall federal spending nearly doubled , from $590.9 billion in 1980 to $1.14 trillion in 1989 . The federal swelling by nearly 5 percent while Reagan occupied the White House . Although his supporters had promised that he would shut down extraneous government programs and agencies , that turned out to be just so much hot air . \"  \" The Reagan Revolution over which he presided was never about fiscal responsibility or small government . The object of the exercise was to give the American people what they wanted , that being the essential precondition for winning reelection in 1984 and consolidating Republican control in Washington . Far more accurately than Jimmy Carter , Reagan understood what made Americans tick : They wanted self-gratification , not self-denial . Although always careful to embroider his speeches with inspirational homilies and testimonials to old-fashioned virtues , Reagan mainly indulged American self-indulgence \" .  Rethinking An American Future  \" For the abused wife , a condition of dependence condemns her to continuing torment . Salvation begins when she rejects that condition and asserts control over her life . Something of the same can be said of the American people .  \" For the United States the pursuit of has induced a condition of dependence -- on imported goods , on imported oil , and on credit . The chief desire of the American people , whether they admit it or not , is that nothing should disrupt their access to those goods , that oil and that credit . The chief aim of the U. S. government is to satisfy that desire , which it does in part through the distribution of largesse at home ( with Congress taking a leading role ) and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad ( largely the business of the executive branch ) .  \" From time to time , various public figures -- even presidents -- make the point that dependence may not be a good thing . Yet meaningful action to reduce this condition is notable by its absence . It 's not difficult to see why . The centers of authority within Washington -- above all the White House and the upper echelons of the national security state -- actually benefit from this dependency : It provides the source of status , power and prerogatives . actually to achieve anything approaching energy independence . U. S. Central Command would go out of business . Dozens of bases in and around the Middle East would close . The navy 's Fifth Fleet would stand down . Weapons contracts worth tens of billions would risk being cancelled .  \" So rather than addressing the problem of dependence , members of our political class seem hell-bent on exacerbating the problem . Rather than acknowledging that American power is not limitless , they pursue policies that actually accelerate the depletion of that power . Certainly , this has been the case since 9/11 . \"  \" Humility imposes an obligation of a different sort . It summons Americans to see themselves without blinders . The enemy of humility is sanctimony , which gives rise to the conviction that American values and beliefs are universal and that the nation itself serves providentially assigned purposes . This conviction finds expression in a determination to remake the world in what we imagine to be America 's image . \"  \" In contemporary American politics , appearances belie reality . Although the 's day , the actual system of governance conceived by the framers -- a federal republic deriving its authority from the people in which the central government exercises limited and specified powers -- no longer pertains . Citizens disgusted with what many see as a perpetual mess in Washington yearn for a restoration of a mythical Old Republic . Yet one might as well hope for the revival of the family farm or for physicians to resume making house calls . \"  \" It would be wrong to charge all the officials employed by these agencies State Department , the armed services , various intelligence agencies , the Joint Chiefs , Office of the Secretary of Defence , National Security Council and the FBI with engaging in a conscious effort to fleece or abuse the American people . Yet it would not be wrong to suggest that in an eagerness to advance institutional interests and protect institutional reputations trumps all other considerations and routinely provides the basis for behavior that is dishonest , unprofessional , unethical , and frequently at odds with the nation 's well-being . \"  \" each reinforcing the other -- no longer exists . If anything , the reverse is true : Expansionism squanders American wealth and power , while putting freedom at risk . As a consequence , the strategic tradition to which Jefferson and Polk , Lincoln and McKinley , TR and FDR all subscribed has been rendered not only obsolete but pernicious . \"  \" No doubt American economic and military power are substantial . Yet when considering the events of the past several years , above all the Iraq War , the president 's ' for us or against us ' ultimatum appears foolhardy in the extreme , and his promise to eliminate evil , manifestly absurd . His policies have done untold damage .... By overstating the Islamist danger , President Bush has committed the United States to a strategy of open-ended global war that can not succeed . Although the Bush administration and its supporters want us to believe that alternatives to waging global war do not exist , that is nonsense . \"  \" Rather than confronting this reality head-on , American grand strategy since the era George W. Bush , has been characterized by attempts to wish reality away . Policy makers have been engaged in a de facto Ponzi scheme intended to extend indefinitely the American line of credit . The fiasco of the Iraq War and the quasi-permanent U. S. occupation of Afghanistan illustrate the results and prefigure what is yet to come if the crisis of American profligacy continues unabated . \"  \" Rather than insisting that the world accommodate the United States , Americans need to reassert control over their own destiny , ending their condition of dependency and abandoning their imperial delusions . Of perhaps even greater difficulty , the combination of economic , political , and military crisis summons Americans to reexamine exactly what freedom entails . Soldiers can not accomplish these tasks , nor should we expect politicians to do so . The onus of responsibility falls squarely on citizens . \"  \" To persist in pretending that the United States is omnipotent is to exacerbate the problems that we face . The longer Americans ignore the implications of dependency and the longer policy makers nurture the pretense , the more precipitous will be its slide when the bills finally come due . \"  The American Military  \" A new national security consensus emerged based on the conviction that the United States military could dominate the planet as Reagan had proposed to dominate outer space . In Washington , confidence that a high-quality military establishment , dexterously employed , could enable the United States , always with high-minded intentions , to organize the world to its liking had essentially become self-evident . In this malignant expectation -- not in any of the conservative ideals for which he is retrospectively venerated -- lies the essence of the Reagan legacy . \"  \" America does n't need a bigger army . It needs a smaller -- that is , more modest -- foreign policy , one that assigns soldiers missions that are consistent with their capabilities . \"  \" Declaring that ' defense is not a budget item , ' Reagan severed the connection between military spending an all other fiscal or political considerations -- a proposition revived by George W. Bush after September 2001 . \" the United States is based on a simple premise : The United States does not start fights . We will never be an aggressor . We maintain our strength in order to deter and defend against aggression -- to preserve freedom and peace . Every item in our defense program -- our ships , our tanks , our planes , our funds for training and spare parts -- is intended for one all-important purpose : to keep the peace . \"  Today , says Bacevich : \" Despite Reagan 's assurances , by the end of the twentieth century , the United States did , in fact , ' start fights ' and seemed well on its way to making that something of a national specialty . \"  \" Even under the most optimistic scenario , Western forces will remain stuck in Afghanistan for many years , if not decades , to come . Although die-hard supporters of the global war on terror will insist otherwise , events in Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated definitively that further reliance on coercive methods will not enable the United States to achieve the Islamic world or subdue it , the military ' option ' is not the answer . \"  \" History has repeatedly demonstrated the irrationality of preventive war . If the world needed a further demonstration , President Bush provided it . Iraq shows us why the Bush Doctrine was a bad idea in the first place and why its abrogation has become essential . For principled guidance in determining when the use of force is appropriate , the country should conform to the Just War tradition -- not only because that tradition is consistent with our professed moral values , but also because its provisions provide an eminently useful guide for sound statecraft . \"  \" Many factors have contributed to the military crisis in which the United States finds itself today : greed , envy , miscalculation , ideological blinders , the nature of the international system , the sins of past generations coming due , the hubris of militarized citizens , the iron law of unintended consequences . But in American Soldier by General Tommy Franks we see on display one additional factor : an approach \"  \" SDI Reagan 's Strategic Defense Initiative prefigured the GWOT , both resting on the assumption that military power offered an antidote to the uncertainties and anxieties of living in a world not run entirely in accordance with American preferences . \"  \" The first lesson to be taken away from the Bush administration 's two military adventures is simply this : War today remains what it has always been -- elusive , untamed , costly , difficult to control , fraught with surprise , and sure to give rise to unexpected consequences . Only the truly demented with imagine otherwise . \"  \" The point of rehearsing this chronicle of misjudgement and miscalculation is simply this : The shortcomings evident in the way that General Tommy Franks planned and executed his two wars were hardly unique . They form part of a pattern . Time and again since the end of the Cold War , senior military officers shouldering the challenge of wartime command have been found wanting . \"  \" The quality of American generalship since the end of the Cold War has seldom U. S. forces may be at an all time high , the same can not be said of the most recent generation of four-star generals and admirals . This is one of those dirty little secrets to which the world 's only superpower has yet to own up . As the United States has come to rely ever more heavily on armed force to prop up its position of global preeminence , the quality of senior American military leadership has been consistently disappointing . The troops are ever willing , the technology remarkable , but first-rate generalship has been hard to come by . \"  \" To credit Reagan with having conceived a full-fledged Persian Gulf strategy would go to far . Indeed , his administration 's immediate response to various crises roiling the region produced a stew of incoherence . In Lebanon , he flung away the lives of 241 marines in a 1983 mission that still defies explanation . The alacrity with which he withdrew U. S. forces from Beirut after a suicide truck bomb had levelled a marine barracks there suggests that there really was no mission the measure of an army 's greatness , nor does fortitude , nor durability , nor technological sophistication . A great army is one that accomplishes its assigned mission . Since George W. Bush inaugurated his global war on terror , the armed forces of the United States have failed to meet that standard . \"  Bacevich on War  \" War 's essential nature is fixed , permanent , intractable , and irrepressible . War 's constant companions are uncertainty and risk . ' War is the realm of chance , ' wrote the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz nearly two centuries ago . ' No other human activity gives it greater scope : no other has such incessant dealings with this intruder , ' a judgement that the invention of the computer , the Internet , and precision-guided munitions has done nothing to overturn . ' The statesman who yields to war fever , ' Churchill correctly observed , ' is no longer the master of policy , but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events . ' Therefore , any notion that innovative techniques and new technologies whimsical . \"  \" When tested , the new American of Way of War yielded more glitter than gold . The generals and admirals who touted the wonders of full spectrum dominance were guilty of flagrant professional malpractice , if not outright fraud . To judge by the record of the past twenty year , U. S. forces win decisively only when the enemy obligingly fights on American terms -- and Saddam Hussein 's demise has drastically reduced the likelihood of finding such accommodating adversaries in the future . As for loose ends , from Somalia to the Balkans , from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf , they have been endemic . \"  Mythologies of America  \" Realism ... implies an obligation to see the world as it actually is , not as we might like it to be . The enemy of realism is hubris , which ... finds expression in an outsized confidence in the efficacy of American power as an instrument to reshape the global order .  \" America 's status as a force for good in a world that pits good against assassinating foreign leaders , overthrowing governments , and undertaking major military interventions . George W. Bush did not invent this practice ; he merely inherited and expanded upon it . \"  \" Crediting the United States with a ' great liberating tradition ' distorts the past and obscures the actual motive force behind American politics and U. S. foreign policy . It transforms history into a morality tale , thereby providing a rationale for dodging serious moral analysis . To insist that the liberation of others has never been more than an ancillary motive of U. S. policy is not cynicism ; it is a prerequisite to self-understanding .  \" If the young United States had a mission , it was not to liberate but to expand . ' Of course , ' declared Theodore Roosevelt in 1899 , as if explaining the self-evident to the obtuse , ' our whole national history has been one of expansion . ' TR spoke truthfully . The founders viewed stasis as tantamount to suicide . From the outset , Americans evinced a compulsion to acquire territory and extend their commercial reach On this point , the historical record leaves no room for debate : by any means necessary . Depending on the circumstances , the United States relied on diplomacy , hard bargaining , bluster , chicanery , intimidation , or naked coercion . We infiltrated land belonging to our neighbors and then brazenly proclaimed it our own . We harassed , filibustered , and , when the situation called for it , launched full-scale invasions . We engaged in ethic cleansing . At times , we insisted that treaties be considered sacrosanct . On other occasions , we blithely jettisoned solemn agreements that had outlived their usefulness .  \" As the methods employed varied , so too did the rationales offered to justify action . We touted our status as God 's new Chosen People , erecting a ' city upon a hill ' destined to illuminate the world . We acted at the behest of providential guidance or responded to the urgings of our ' manifest destiny ' . We declared our obligation to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ or to ' uplift little brown brother . ' responsibility to ' show the way to the nations of the world how they shall walk in the paths of liberty . ' Critics who derided these claims as bunkum -- the young Lincoln during the war with Mexico , Mark Twain after the imperial adventures of 1898 , Senator Robert La Follette amid ' the war to end all wars ' -- scored points but lost arguments . Periodically revised and refurbished , American exceptionalism ( which implied exceptional American prerogatives ) only gained greater currency . \"  The U.S. Government hijacked  I was aware many years ago that the \" arms race \" between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. was something trumped up on the American side , but Bacevich gives us the background and relevant details .  \" Today , everything about the national security state is gargantuan : its payroll , total budget , organizational complexity , appetite for information , ability to churn out reams of self-justifying press releases , and capacity for dissembling , chicanery and dirty tricks . The Pentagon alone houses a workforce of 25,000 employees , who each day while occupying 3,705,793 square feet of office space , traipsing over 17.5 miles of corridors , mounting 131 staircases , watching 4,200 clocks , drinking from 691 water fountains , and relieving themselves in 284 lavatories . \"  In early 1950 , Paul Nitze of the NSC prepared a secret report for President Truman and the NSC called NSC 68 in which American military buildup was the only realistic response to international communism . \" It also argued for higher taxes to make available the resources needed to fund rearmament . In effect , this ' Nitze doctrine ' offered a recipe for the permanent militarization of U. S. policy . \" ( my emphasis )  Most important , however , Nitze \" devised the technique of artfully designing ' options ' to yield precooked conclusions , thereby allowing the analyst to become the de facto decision maker . \" ( My emphasis . I think it is vitally important to recognize this usurpation of power in the chain of command . )  \" He showed how easily American ideals could be employed to camouflage American ambitions , expansionism . Above all , however , Nitze demonstrated the inestimable value of sowing panic as a means of driving the policy-making process . When it came to removing obstacles and loosening purse strings , the Nitze Doctrine worked wonders . \"  \" Even today , for neoconservatives like Max Boot , Thomas Donnelly , and Frederick Kagan , NSC 68 retains a talismanic significance , a model for what a ' coherent grand strategy ' ought to look like . According to Kagan , a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , Nitze 's handiwork offers ' a vision of the security policy America must pursue for as long as it is a global power . Yet what some see as coherence appears in another light as extreme agitation laced with paranoia , delusions of grandeur , and a cavalier disregard for empirical truth . To read NSC 68 today is to enter a hothouse of apprehension , dread and panic -- the same combination of emotions that helped facilitate the Iraq War with as little connection to reality . NSC 68 was an exercise in fearmongering , which Nitze 's day to the present . \"  \" No doubt today 's Wise Men see themselves as devoted patriots . No doubt they even mean well . Yet that 's not good enough . As Paul Wolfowitz himself wrote ; ' No U. S. president can justify a policy that fails to achieve its intended results by pointing to the purity and rectitude of his intentions . ' Much the same can be said of those who advise presidents and whose advice yields horrific consequences of the sort we have endured beginning on 9/11 and continuing ever since . They have forfeited any further claim to trust . \"  \" None of these , beginning with the NSC 68 's phantasmagoric description of Soviet capabilities and intentions in 1950 , turned out to be accurate . In each and every case , proponents of the Nitze Doctrine garbled the facts and magnified the danger . The bomber and missile gaps of the Eisenhower era were figments of overactive imaginations . Even as its nuclear arsenal grew in the 1960s and 1970s , the Soviet Union never achieved anything Rumsfeld Commission , its conclusions have proven entirely bogus . Yet in each of these cases , as with NSC 68 , the hue and cry concocted by Wise Men produced the intended result . \"  \" The Wise Men may not be overtly or consciously malevolent . To charge them with inventing threats out of whole cloth would be manifestly unfair . Yet from the era of Forrestal and Nitze to the present , they have repeatedly misconstrued and exaggerated existing threats , with perverse effects . \"  \" Yet if presidents have accrued too much power , if the Congress is feckless , if the national security bureaucracy is irretrievably broken , the American people have only themselves to blame . They have allowed their democracy to be hijacked . The hijackers will not voluntarily return what they have stolen . \"  Nuclear Weapons  \" Nuclear weapons are unusable . Their employment in any conceivable scenario would be a political and moral catastrophe . For the United States , they are becoming unnecessary , even as a deterrent . Certainly they are unlikely to dissuade -- Islamic extremists intent on acquiring their own nuclear capability .  \" For the United States , abolishing nuclear weapons ought to be an urgent national security priority . So too should preserving our planet . These are the meta challenges of our time . Addressing them promises to be the work of decades . Yet ridding the world of nuclear weapons is likely to prove far more plausible and achievable than ridding the world of evil . Transforming humankind 's relationship to the environment , which will affect the way people live their daily lives , can hardly prove more difficult than transforming the Greater Middle East , which requires the way a billion or more Muslims think . \"  \" By retaining a strategic arsenal in readiness ( and by insisting without qualification that the dropping of atomic bombs on two Japanese cities in 1945 was justified ) , the United States continues tacitly to sustain the view that nuclear weapons play a legitimate role in international politics -- this at a time when our own interests are best served by doing everything possible to reinforce the Thread of Hope  Although he is self-proclaimed conservative , Bacevich comes across as a genuinely human person ( I 've seen him speak in a video ) he makes one extremely telling comment : \" Pick the group : blacks , Jews , women , Asians , Hispanics , working stiffs , gays , the handicapped--in every case the impetus for providing to equal access to the rights guaranteed by the Constitution originated among pinks , lefties , liberals , and bleeding-heart fellow travelers . When it came to ensuring that every American should get a fair shake , the contribution of modern conservatism has been essentially nil . Had Martin Luther King counted on William F. Buckley and the National Review to take up the fight against racial segregation in the 1950s and 1960s , Jim Crow would still be alive and well . \"  A word from Benjamin Franklin  In a May 9 1754 newspaper Franklin produced this editorial cartoon . The object was to encourage the states to band together .  So it is today , but on a global scale . And the to decide to join the rest of the human race on the planet instead of staying with the pig-headed belief that everyone must fit them . We have and have had so-called Rogue States like Libya and North Korea , but after reading Bacevich 's analysis , it 's hard not to come to the conclusion that the United States is biggest Rogue State of all . And if the United States does n't reform it ways and attitudes , and that right smartly , then there 's only one thing left to say :  God help everyone else on the planet !  Personal Conclusion  Based on what Bacevich has said I believe that the future of America rests in the hands of the \" pinks , lefties , liberals , and bleeding-heart fellow travelers \" . They are the only group of people , despite their differing approaches , who want to drag the rest of American society , kicking and screaming , into the future and toward a better world for all .  Daniel Johnson was born near the midpoint of the twentieth century in was going to be a writer , which is why he was one of only a handful of boys in his high school typing class -- a skill he knew was going to be necessary . He defines himself as a social reformer , not a left winger , the latter being an ideological label which , he says , is why he is not an ideologue . From 1975 to 1981 he was reporter , photographer , then editor of the weekly Airdrie Echo . For more than ten years after that he worked with Peter C. Newman , Canada 's top business writer ( notably on a series of books , The Canadian Establishment ) . Through this period Daniel also did some national radio and TV broadcasting . He gave up journalism in the early 1980s because he had no interest in being a hack writer for the mainstream media and became a software developer and programmer . He retired from computers last year and is now back to doing what he loves -- writing and trying to make the world a better place  All comments and unacceptable comments are denied .  Hank Ruark January 3 , 2010 3:57 pm ( Pacific time )  D. Benson : Yours assumes someone trying to force us into some form of world government or some kind of world \" constitution \" . Do you then contend there is no place for strong , rational and reasonable cooperation by nations around the world ? We have start on that NOW in the U.N. , sacrificed and sometimes sabotaged by U.S. for its own interests . We have that NOW in various other working agencies , as in Copenhagen recently , and over decades in widespread and very essential units needing closer and more effective governance . Do we sacrifice all possible progressive actions and again retreat behind isolation and its deepening dangers in this new 21st Century ? Hang on , sir , we may just find we got ta go there simply to guarantee there will still be a world --and any future for the human race .  douglas benson January 3 , 2010 10:27 am ( Pacific time )  I left a comment yesterday but do . I guess it boils down to this the American peoples response to join the new world order or die is give me liberty or give me death . There is room for middle ground but we will never accept joiningovertly a one world goverment or a world constitution ever .  Your comment yesterday is no where to be seen . Sorry .  It 's America 's \" my way or the highway \" attitude to sharing the globe with other people that is a significant stumbling block to human progress . Over the last half century America 's irresponsibility in terms of selfishly overusing world resources , just because it could , threatening life on the planet with nuclear destruction , just because it could , invading other countries whenever it felt it to its advantage , just because it could . I could go on . This article is about what Bacevich said in his book . What part of Bacevich do you not agree with . There 's an old saying--insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results . Do you can can somehow get better . Or , or as Bush and Rumsfeld said , everyone has to fit America 's agenda ? No rant or ideology and I will be happy to discuss these issues with you .

Re cabal and consequences , can only say :  Thomas the Troll January 2 , 2010 1:37 pm ( Pacific time )  Since you have this remakable need to make warlike comments about my country , from this moment forward I will consider you an enemy to my country in the same level as any other enemy that represents a threat to the welfare of my people .  Really ? Considering that not a single idea in the piece was mine , but I was reviewing Andrew J. Bacevich , does that make him an enemy of your people are you ? You and your trollish ideas are not welcome at this site . Go to a site where they already agree with you . Happy New Year .  Hank Ruark January 2 , 2010 9:47 am ( Pacific time )  Thomas : Yours re Cold War ' America 's fault \" is at least partially true --unwittingly on your part until/unless you have read DUTCH and much more . ( See text-there re Commie wall and its collapse ... ) Most trained analysts now agree Reagan-stand from early California days clearly meant to ride wave of public opinion for personal open political purposes , due to decline of acting career and driven by long , close association with GE for plant visits and \" the speech \" before many thousands there --ironic from former union leader confronting corporations in Hollywood . \" See again \" DUTCH et al ; full page refs. on request , with same small fee ... Continued \" defy , deny \" never defeats flat-facts when well reported from accessed public record ... no matter with what political intensity same may be felt am ( Pacific time )  See , the Cold War was America 's fault .  I 'm not trying to tell you anything . If you want to debate Bacevich 's points , that 's one thing . You have your mind already made up with pre-digested propaganda with no room for new thinking . So , in posting here , you 're wasting your time and , more infinitely valuable , my time . Do n't look to my stories in future to spout more of your 18th century \" wisdom \" .  Hank Ruark January 2 , 2010 9:12 am ( Pacific time )  Thomas : For free : See DUTCH Index for some 30 references to Iran/Contra . Check esp . pp.615/616 for embarrassingly clear answer re whole Iran/Contra affair , with absolutely clear affirmation of impacts then of later diagnosed Alzheimer 's . Yours implies unprofessional and unethical statement by me to simply satisfy personal grudge vs Reagan . UNTRUE - a reporter reports , as I do . That is desperate defense of your malign-measured words here , and I will expect Credibility is all-there-is for professional writer . I 've earned mine , with name fully visible on every word ever written ( except when role is as ghost-writer ! ) . SO NOW \" put up or shut up \" , with public open to observe . Cite documentation of your words from reliable sources , as I just did -- or withdraw damaging , denigrating words you wrote --and published . You wrote it , so now prove it or withdraw it ...  Hank Ruark January 2 , 2010 8:40 am ( Pacific time )  Friend Thomas :  You confuse illumination of public-record truth with my reference to near-treasonable behavior by both-named Your error reflects in rest of yours here , too . Court records , national TV-brdcst , current press reporting all show Reagan admission of North role as what it surely was ... excused by concept of \" under orders \" now rejected by Supremes in other cases . Have you read DUTCH , by Reagan 's own choice of biographer ? He tells of hospital-bed scene when RR okayed North-action . Until you do if Malign here rejected . Were YOU in D.C , thus able to closely observe at the time of these events ? That 's only solid basis for your words ; written records by those who WERE there-then support mine .  Want ten fully-qualified other commentators stating same flat facts ? That 's documentation here for what I have written repeatedly re Reagan --never challenged by anyone with offsetting documentation . \" American exceptionalism \" doth exist , deserves better by far than you-and-yours now provide for it by rampant remotism to 19th Century Come out from behind your single-name mask with full ID and working phone to Editor , for PDF with documentation . A small fee ( $25 ) for computer transfer .  Thomas January 2 , 2010 8:05 am ( Pacific time )  I find it amusing that during a much vaulted game such as the Rose Bowl we have a poster who can not help themselves from making a dig at Reagan and Olie North , two extremely popular figures who had far more knowledge of what was happening in Central and South America from Oregon University will be back next year . I would also suggest that we Americans will not subordinate our country to anyone . It will not happen , and we will grow out of this recession regardless of the failed policies coming out of Washington . If you want to get a current taste of American \" majority \" feelings , see some recent polls that show over 6 out of 10 Americans would like to see the Xmas day bomber undergo harsh interrogation techniques and be prosecuted via military authorities . The strong patriotic and nationalistic feelings felt by a \" majority \" of Americans will roll back any attempt to transform our destiny .  Head still in the 18th century , is it Thomas ? Everyone has moved on but the Americans , who have run out of countries to exploit and on which to base their growth , as Bacevich clearly explained . Time to put the flintlocks away .  Hank Ruark January 1 , 2010 7:03 pm ( Pacific time )  \" Anon \" et al :  ANY time commenter dares not is then stated but most of what may be connected with it , too . Surest proof of pusillanimous cogitative evasion and malign distorting perversion is open attack on writer with no fact and only futile fantasy in the awkward , messy message . Bryzinski , Kissinger et al would shudder at unfair and moribund connection with you or any part of yours here . Have you ever read any of their prized output ? In fact , are you able to read ?  I live in my mother 's basement January 1 , 2010 4:10 pm ( Pacific time )  daniel : if you were to actually read books by those who control the western world , you just might have something to say . You truly , do not have a clue to what is going on . But I understand , canada already lost any type of learning or creative thoughts . But , the U.S. still has a few that can still find info and books to read . Get with the rest of the planet ? the swine flu epidemic lies ? canadians also , the global warming scam ? Is THAT the world you want us to join ? You can have it . If you want to do something that is actually constructive to this planet , get behind the patriots of integrity and our Constitution , and help the U.S. get rid of this rogue government . They already have canada , but they will not get the U.S. Could use a little help here tho , instead of whining about something you have no idea about . Bryzinski books , kissinger books , holders books , hillary clintons thesis that just came out . You know nothing of this do you ? did nt think so .  Oh , and you 're one of the enlightened ones who do have a clue , are you ? If you want to get rid of your rogue government , get out of your mom 's basement and do it yourself .

                   The shooting took place at dawn on April 18 , but Davidson , a farmer and former school computer chief failed to notify authorities until about 8 p.m , after which officers found Wilson 's body in his own basement .  Four days after the incident , Davidson and his partner , Buck , were testifying in favor of legalizing homosexual marriage in Maine , an effort that ultimately failed . The pair proclaimed they \" were already married in the eyes of God . \"  According to the Record , which is published by the Civic League , \" Despite the sordid nature of the crime , reports published at the time portrayed Wilson and LaVallee-Davidson as innocent as choirboys . To date , there has been no mention in the mainstream press of what actually happened in the basement of Fred Wilson 's home in South Portland . Indeed , the mainstream press added to the confusion by reporting that the shooting was ' a kind of Russian Roulette ' gone wrong . \"  Indeed , coverage from the Portland Press-Herald shows asked if the homosexual pair were playing Russian Roulette when the .44 caliber handgun was fired .  \" Something along those lines , \" Stokes told the paper , refusing to be more specific about the evidence or circumstances .  \" There was handling of the gun throughout the evening , \" he said . \" It 's not clear how the gun got loaded . \"  \" Mr. Davidson pointed a gun at Mr. Wilson and deliberately pulled the trigger , not intending to kill . Believing a gun is not loaded is not enough in our view . It 's a deadly weapon . \"  Because of the victim 's connections to the homosexual bondage-and-discipline , sadomasochistic subculture and the location and time of the crime -- a Friday night in the basement of Wilson 's house -- it is almost certain that the shooter and the victim were engaged in debauchery during the evening , and that LaVallee-Davidson pulled the trigger in a drug and alcohol-induced stupor . This conjecture was confirmed by the unexpected revelation that Wilson was a member of Portland 's the practice of sadomasochism .  The Record went on to state that perhaps the most troubling aspect of the story was Davidson 's tearful performance at a public hearing as he lobbied for same-sex marriage just four days after he allegedly killed Wilson :  It is highly likely that individuals within the state government and the same-sex marriage movement knew of LaVallee-Davidson 's alleged involvement in the shooting , but took no measures to prevent him from testifying so prominently . In May , a source told the Record that the police who guarded the Civic Center during the hearing knew that LaVallee-Davidson had killed a man four days earlier . The Record subsequently began its own inquiry into finding out who in state government knew that an alleged killer was going to testify in favor of gay marriage .  In November , an attorney for Davidson suggested his client may have been suffering from AIDS-related dementia at the time of the shooting , thus clearing the way for a possible insansity defense .  Frank Lombard  Jury selection for Davidson 's trial is set to begin later in Cumberland County Superior Court in Portland .  This case of homosexual-related crimes being ignored by the national media is hardly unique .  In July , WND reported how news coverage of Duke University official Frank Lombard , accused of raping his adopted 5-year-old son and offering the child to someone else , omitted the fact that Lombard is a homosexual who lives with another \" gay \" man .   \n",

          Eat , Pray , Love , Then Commit  Elizabeth Gilbert , famous fugitive from marriage , talks to fellow writer Ann Patchett about ' ' til death do us part '  By  Ann Patchett  Updated Jan. 2 , 2010 12:01 a.m . ET  Elizabeth Gilbert and I met several years ago when we spoke on a panel to a group of librarians , and what started off as mutual admiration quickly turned to friendship . Even though she lives in New Jersey and I live in Nashville we write massive letters back and forth ( the old-fashioned kind with envelopes and stamps ) and take any occasion we can to see one another . When I was recently speaking at a library in Connecticut , I flew up a night early and she borrowed an apartment from a friend who was out of town so we could meet up for dinner and have a slumber party with her dog , Rocky .  ENLARGE  Elizabeth Gilbert with her husband on her wedding day in February 2007  I was lucky enough : A Skeptic Makes Peace With Marriage , \" when it was still just a pile of paper , and not only did I read it , I had a hand in shaping the final product by insisting that she include the word \" pachyderm \" when discussing elephants . In doing so I left my mark on greatness . Multitaskers that we are , we also decided to write this interview in our pajamas on the couch , handing my computer back and forth and typing up our conversation about marriage ( I typed the questions , she typed the answers -- clearly she is the better typist ) . Her marriage is nearly two years old and mine is going on five . It turns out we had a lot to say .  Ann Patchett : So , Liz , is marriage going to survive ?  Elizabeth Gilbert : Marriage has a Darwinian ability to endure . It 's the most impressive thing I discovered about marriage . It alters itself however necessary to continue to be relevant and useful in people 's lives . It is . Marriage will be here long after humans are gone . What I came away from this book with was an unexpected and deep respect for marriage . People will always want intimacy with one chosen person and you can not have intimacy without privacy , which is why couples draw circles of privacy around themselves . They demand that family , neighbors and the law respect their union , and that is why we have marriage .  AP : What 's your view on having a range of options for marriage , going from a civil union to common law marriage to the Super Vows . I do n't think Super Vows ever got much traction .  EG : The Super Vows -- or what proponents call \" Covenant Marriage \" -- never got any traction . The idea was to offer couples an option : they could essentially choose between \" marriage lite , \" with an easy , no-fault divorce option , or \" marriage for life , \" the full handcuffs . Curiously enough , medieval Germans had the same package of options . Back -- given the choice -- select the lighter bond . Even in the heat of love , it 's as though we all understand that the future is a mystery , and it 's best to keep your options open , just in case , God forbid , it does n't last .  Journal Community  Also , as somebody who , in my second marriage , insisted on a prenuptial agreement , I can also testify that sometimes it is an act of love to chart the exit strategy before you enter the union , in order to make sure that not only you , but your partner as well , knows that there will be no World War III should hearts and minds , for any sad reason , change . As for the idea of creating such a thing as secular civil unions that would offer couples every legal advantage of marriage without using the language of marriage -- as they now do in Europe -- this makes perfect sense ... or rather , it would if we Americans did not happen to hold the concept of is , in this country , a civil union will always be seen as a badge of second-class citizenship .  AP : But then what 's the point of marriage ? Would n't it be more honorable , and more honest , to embrace the Northern European path and say , hey , we 're going to do our best to stay together for the family , even if we 're unmarried ? What is marriage if it is n't forever ? What then separates us from Britney Spears ?  EG : Oh , Ann , Ann , Ann . Please do n't force me to make a list of what separates me from Britney Spears . Marriage is a strange combination of dream and reality , and we spend our lives as couples trying to negotiate that divide . I will say this , because I think it is the single most important piece of information in the whole story : Marriage is not a game for the young . One lesson that Britney can teach us is : Do n't get married when you 're 20 years need to explain . Maturity brings -- among other things -- the ability to sustain and survive enormous contradictions and disappointments . Marriage is -- among other things -- a study in contradiction and disappointment , and inside that reality there is space for us to truly learn how to love . But it is wise to check at least a few of our most idealistic youthful dreams at the door before entering .  AP : Many people confuse weddings with marriage , or they do n't think past the wedding to the marriage . What are your feelings about weddings and how do they figure into the bigger picture of marriage ?  ENLARGE  Ann Patchett delivers a speech to the Clemson University incoming freshman class in Clemson , S.C. , August 2006 Associated Press  EG : I think this is a particular trap for women -- especially young women of the romantic variety , which is to say : young women . I myself have never been enchanted by the dream of the white wedding , and , heaven help us , the expectation that this of one 's life . But I did ask a number of my heartsick single female friends about this very question , and one of them gave me a truthful and illuminating answer : The fantasy of the wedding day is that it represents undeniable public and private truth that you have been chosen . For that one day , you are the most valuable creature in the world -- a treasure , a princess , a prize . For many women , who have never felt chosen or desirable or precious , this is an unshakable yearning . And I 'm afraid many women do choose the wedding over the marriage . It seems a steep price to pay , but it comes from a place of deep , sad longing to be loved and to have it proven that you are of value .  AP : Is there anything good about the public wedding ?  EG : Sorry ! Yes , of course . The gathering of family , obviously . The dancing is often fun . And one would have to be a troll not to of ceremony and ritual , which all humans crave and need : the public exchange of vows symbolizes for everyone within the tribe that the status of this couple has changed , that these two have made the transition into a new phase of life . I think all that is nice . What I object to is the hyper-fetishized wedding day , the prioritizing of wedding over marriage . Which is to say , I have a real problem with couples spending far more time discussing the seating arrangement or the color of the bridesmaid 's gowns than hashing out , for instance , their feelings about how they intend to handle questions of housework , child-rearing , finances and fidelity for the next four or five decades .  AP : How do you account for the falling rates of marriage in Europe ?  EG : Hmmm , very good question . I was hoping you did n't know about that . I thought we were talking about marriage in America .  AP : But your book is definitely not about marriage in America . It 's global marriage only so far as the information I discovered affected me when I encountered it , for instance when I met the Hmong personally . The book is about my efforts to find a small corner of the history of matrimony in which I would feel comfortable . So it 's mostly an American perspective because I 'm mostly an American . The Europeans do not share our innate cultural reverence for marriage , at least not the northern Europeans . The Portuguese still do . Here 's the thing : the unit of reverence in Europe is the family , which is why a child born today of unmarried parents in Sweden has a better chance of growing up in a house with both of his parents than a child born to a married couple in America . Here we revere the couple , there they revere the family . This is also why homosexuals in Europe have no comprehension of why homosexuals in America are fighting for the right to marry : They are perfectly happy to simply have equal civil rights , without the language of marriage mystical , intangible power : It is a passport to adulthood and respectability and to a certain extent citizenship . Any relationship less than \" married \" is considered temporary and not worthy of honor .  AP : Now that you 're married do you feel you 've been the recipient of all this gravity ?  EG : Yes . You do n't feel it or understand it until you have it . I moved to a small town in rural New Jersey with my husband and the very fact that I could introduce him as my \" husband \" -- rather than my boyfriend , or sweetheart or , God forbid , life partner -- meant that we were instantly trusted , instantly welcomed , instantly legitimized . Our marriage was a huge shortcut to social respectability , and there are countless tangible and intangible benefits of that . He and I are rebellious and stubborn enough that we would have foregone those benefits , but now that we have them , they lend us undeniable power .  AP : As someone who dated her husband for get married because I did n't want to take on the ease of that social acceptance or fall into the ruts of conformity in my relationship , I have to ask if you see any downside in all of this acceptance ?  EG : I think it 's unfortunate that there exists only one path in America to complete social legitimacy , and that is marriage . I think , for instance , that it would be far easier for Americans to elect a black president or a female president than an unmarried president . That would truly feel like cause for suspicion . Which means -- of course -- there is a massive pressure to apply this particular shape to one 's relationship . Which might explain why Americans marry more -- and , sadly , divorce more -- than anyone else in the industrialized world . So the downside is that there is a rush to the altar -- couples want to earn that badge of instant respect -- when they perhaps are unready , or not mature enough , to actually take on that commitment .  done and your book is written , what do you think actually constitutes the state of marriage ?  EG : Well , of course , this has changed over the centuries . In the ancient world , marriage was a tribal bond -- a means of legitimizing heirs and building family dynasties . In the medieval world , marriage was an economic bond -- a means of safely passing wealth from one generation to the next . During the height of the Catholic church 's power , marriage was a religious bond -- a lifelong , unbreakable contract to God , sealed by a priest . During the Industrial Revolution , with the rise of prosperity across the Western world , marriage finally gained the luxury of becoming a bond of love , an expression of individualistic choice . Today , marriage is a curious amalgam of all those things . Modern marriage is first and foremost a romantic and private union , but the tax laws and inheritance laws and religious implications that still surround this institution indicate that marriage has evolved without casting away its earlier purposes or this thing , piling new advancements on the old model . I think of modern marriage as a car strangely fashioned out of an old abandoned horse carriage , built upon the framework of a mule cart . All the original engineering is still there , underneath it all . Whether we are aware of it or not , we carry into our modern marriages the expectations and social memory of thousands of years of history , as well as our own set of newfangled tools that we use to tinker daily with the old machine . We alter and customize the thing every century , every generation , every day -- both in the courts and in our own homes . And marriage accepts our modifications gracefully . Marriage adapts , evolves and ( in a manner that I find miraculous and kind of inspiring ) somehow keeps chugging along .  -- Ann Patchett is the author of seven books , including the novel \" Bel Canto . \" Her most recent novel is \" Run . \" Elizabeth Gilbert is the author of \" Eat , Pray , Skeptic Makes Peace With Marriage . \"  This copy is for your personal , non-commercial use only .

      But in his rollicking new book \" Star : How Warren Beatty Seduced America \" ( Simon &amp; Schuster ) , biographer Peter Biskind hazards a guess about the conquests of Hollywood 's most notorious lothario -- based , he says , on \" simple arithmetic . \"  Biskind estimates \" 12,775 women , give or take , a figure that does not include daytime quickies , drive-bys , casual gropings , stolen kisses and so on . \"  As it turns out , the \" Bonnie and Clyde \" star was a late bloomer and did n't lose his virginity until he was almost 20 -- but he would make up for lost time in the decades to follow , bedding just about every woman on Hollywood 's ever-changing A-list , as well as any other woman who happened to , literally , cross paths with him .  Beatty has never been a kiss-and-tell guy , though . To the immense frustration of interviewers over the years , writes Biskind , \" even when he appears to be saying something , he is Hollywood writer , formed a surprising friendship with the actor -- and , at 72 , Beatty finally agreed to an authorized biography , dishing on his long list of leading ladies :  JANE FONDA  When a young Beatty auditioned for a teen movie , \" Parrish , \" in 1960 , his scene partner was a fresh-faced actress named Jane Fonda .  On the first take , Beatty gave her a brief , chaste kiss . \" I thought he was gay , \" Fonda tells Biskind . Director Joshua Logan was not having it . \" Look , are you afraid of Jane or something ? Grab her , boy , grab her . Do n't be shy . \" It was a directive that Beatty would apply to his love life forever after . \" Oh , my God . We kissed until we had practically eaten each other 's heads off , \" Beatty tells Biskind .  The two went on to become an item , and Beatty would later rave about Fonda 's sexual prowess \" due to her ability to virtually much larger than itself . \"  JOAN COLLINS  As Fonda remembers it , she and Beatty were dining at Beverly Hills restaurant La Scala when her boyfriend spotted British actress Joan Collins across the room . As Collins was moping about her fading affair with Cloris Leachman 's producer husband , she \" noticed the indecently pretty young man boldly eyeing her from a nearby table . He was 22 at the time , but he looked like he was barely old enough to drive . \"  Beatty dropped Fonda for Collins , and the two became an inseparable , insatiable couple . \" He made love to Joan Collins relentlessly , \" Biskind writes . \" But for Collins , it was too much of a good thing . One Sunday morning , exhausted , she stumbled out of bed . Dragging on a forbidden cigarette , she said , ' I do n't think I can last much longer . He never stops -- it must be all those vitamins he takes . . . In a few years , I 'll be worn out . had sex seven times a day . She replied , ' Maybe he did , but I just lay there . ' \"  SHIRLEY MacLAINE  Beatty 's older sister was an early contender for the role of Bonnie in \" Bonnie and Clyde \" -- that is , until her brother began to think about starring in the film as well as producing it .  \" With Beatty starring , MacLaine was out , \" Biskind writes . \" She quipped , ' That would be adding incest to injury . ' Beatty was unamused by her attempts at humor at his expense . As in , ' I 'd love to do a kissing scene with him , to see what all the fuss is about . . . I keep my daughter as far away from Warren as possible ! ' \"  JULIE CHRISTIE  When Beatty first spotted the gorgeous English actress , it was in 1965 , and she was an Oscar contender for her lead role in \" Darling . \" As actress Leslie Caron , another of Beatty 's longtime loves psychology . He always falls in love with girls who have won or been nominated for an Academy Award . \"  Beatty and Christie had a long , passionate , often turbulent relationship -- mostly due to Beatty 's chronic inability to be faithful . When he was shooting 1974 's \" The Parallax View , \" for example , his trailer had a steady stream of female admirers coming and going . An intern on the film recalled being surprised that \" some of the girls outside Beatty 's trailer who got past the door were not particularly attractive , especially since Julie Christie , who was doing ' Uncle Vanya ' on Broadway , was flying in to spend every weekend with him . Some were chubby , some had hints of mustaches on their upper lips . Some had the errant pimple or mole or other blemishes . \"  Beatty was an equal-opportunity seducer , Biskind writes , who would have sex at the drop of a hat and for an ever-expanding number of reasons . \" Late in 1971 , he implored singer-songwriter Carole King with him because , he explained , he 'd never been with a late-term woman and wanted to see what it was like . ( She refused . ) One night he got a phone call from a woman he did n't remember , who was married and lived in Colorado . She 'd had breast cancer and a mastectomy . Her husband did n't want to sleep with her anymore . Beatty was outraged , told her ' I 'd f- -- -- you in a second . Fly out here . ' \"  DIANE KEATON  In keeping with Caron 's Oscar scorecard , Beatty 's interest in actress Diane Keaton perked up right after she won Best Actress for 1977 's \" Annie Hall . \"  \" I was n't the Warren Beatty type , but there I was , \" Keaton tells Biskind . \" He was just so . . . overwhelming in every way . I remember looking at his face and going , ' How am I here with this ? ' The brilliance and the talent , you get caught up the role of Louise Bryant in Beatty 's film \" Reds , \" where his more controlling side came out during one audition , writes Biskind . \" George Plimpton , who was offered the part of a lecherous publisher in ' Reds ' after he literally tripped over Beatty asleep on the floor of the Playboy Mansion , auditioned for it by kissing Keaton with so much conviction that Beatty yelled , ' Stop it . ' \"  The combination of Beatty 's charm and his compulsive need to be in control would surface with many subsequent lovers -- such as actress Joyce Hyser , who ended up in therapy because of him .  \" Her therapist always told her that her relationship with Beatty was a mistake , \" Biskind writes . \" He would say , ' You got ta get outta there , you got ta break it off , it 's not right for you . ' Beatty , who was a therapy junkie , wanted to join her . She recalls , ' Within 10 minutes , Warren had completely taken over the Why do you feel you need to leave ? \" My therapist was totally in love with him . ' \"  FRAN DRESCHER  The nasal-voiced star of \" The Nanny \" read for a small role in Beatty 's famous 1987 flop , \" Ishtar , \" and recalls one colorful exchange with the actor , who was sleeping with the film 's star , Isabelle Adjani . \" He offered to introduce her to Adjani , saying , ' We were both talking about you while lying in bed last night . ' Adjani told her , ' You are very beautiful . ' But it was n't until Beatty added , ' We were both hoping you would like to join us for dinner this evening , just the three of us , ' that the flashbulb went off : ' I sure as hell knew a m ? nage- ? -troiserino when I saw one , ' she thought . \" Drescher turned down the offer .  JANICE DICKINSON  The wild-child supermodel ended up in Beatty 's hotel room and tells Biskind she went the middle of the night . \" I looked across the room and found him admiring himself in the mirror . . . In the morning , when I woke up , he was standing there again , playing with his hair , mussing it ; trying to get it just right -- going for that just-been-f- -- -ed look . \"  MADONNA  When Beatty cast Madonna in the role of Breathless Mahoney in 1990 's \" Dick Tracy , \" which he was both directing and starring in , he locked onto the pop star as his latest conquest . She turned out to be more than he bargained for .  Nightclub-loving Madonna would drag Beatty out to the gay discos with her , and try unsuccessfully to get him to dance ( \" Hey , P- -- -y Man , come on out here \" ) while pals like Sandra Bernhard hung around and made fun of him . \" We would taunt him , say things to make him uncomfortable . In a loving way . He was a perfect target , because he played ' ' Huh ? ' ' What 's all this craziness ? ' The whole relationship was a performance . \"  \" Beatty , a man who was accustomed to being worshipped by women , was on dangerous ground with Madonna , \" Biskind writes . \" Why he sat still for this kind of treatment remains a mystery . Chances are , he was taking his own advice . He would tell director Glenn Gordon Caron a few years later , ' Never , ever f- -- -- your leading lady . And if you do , do n't stop till the picture 's finished . ' \"  ANNETTE BENING  Barry Levinson 's 1991 movie \" Bugsy \" is probably best known as the movie that domesticated Warren Beatty . His first meeting with actress Annette Bening , who was vying for a role in the film , made an impression on \" Bugsy \" screenplay writer James Toback , now a director .  \" He let out this growl . . . A primordial yelp of love , lust , desire , enthusiasm , a at the prospect of finally being able to devour a huge and delicious meal . I realized that without question the role was already now settled , \" Toback tells the author .  The rest is history . How did Bening succeed in taming the actor where so many others had failed ? Beatty himself offered a possible explanation to a former girlfriend , actress Delaune Michel . \" I think back sometimes on a few of the women who were in my life before , the ones my mind naturally wanders to , the heavyweights , like you . I could have married any one of you and been happy . There is n't just one true love for anyone ; timing is everything . \"  ' I do n't think I can last much longer . He never stops -- it must be all those vitamins he takes . . . In a few years I 'll be worn out . '  -- Joan Collins  ' He let out this growl . . . A primordial yelp of love , lust , desire , enthusiasm to make at the prospect of finally being able to devour a huge and delicious meal . '   \n",

                                                                                                                                      \" Thursdays with Abie \" / \" Field of Streams \" / \" Big Man on Hippocampus \" / \" Do n't Look a Smith Horse in the Mouth \"  I almost missed the return of the Fox animated bloc tonight because who programs the Sunday after New Year 's ? Is n't this the time when networks burn off shows and pretend that no one is watching them ? Maybe this is why Fox chose what ended up being a pretty weak slate of episodes to kick off the new year , four shows that never came together , with two of them being actively pretty bad . I enjoyed The Simpsons and American Dad to varying degrees , but The Cleveland Show and Family Guy both had their moments while still never coming together to make satisfying episodes . It 's a new year , and whether Fox just burned these episodes off or whatever , it 's time to take them to task ! Or talk generally about their disappointments and the histories of each shows , as it were .  The have hung on to their ability to move us . Most Homer and Lisa episodes are still touching on some level , while most Bart and Lisa episodes play off the two 's easy camaraderie . One of the exceptions to this rule is the relationship between Homer and his dad . The two had some great episodes in the show 's early going , as the series examined the way that Abe 's inability to be a good single parent reverberated down through the years ( in a much , much funnier way than that sounds ) . Episodes like \" Grampa vs . Sexual Inadequacy \" and \" Mother Simpson \" focused in on the way the seeming hatred Homer had for his dad was driven by something deeper , and they were weirdly emotionally resonant . But over the years , some of the spark has gone out of this relationship , as the show has mostly just turned to storylines where Homer realizes how lucky he is to have his dad . This was another one of those , as Grampa told some of his rambling stories by the guy , only to be saved by Homer at the last minute . The fact that The Simpsons endlessly resets itself does n't really hurt the relationships between the parents and their kids or between the siblings because those are the kinds of relationships that are always , essentially , resetting themselves , until adolescence starts to firm them up . That Homer and his dad ca n't come to any sort of movement forward feels forced , I think , and means these kinds of stories have to get more and more out there . On the other hand , I liked the Bart and Lisa B-plot , as the two tried to rescue the stuffed lamb Bart had brought home from school for the weekend ( even if its resolution was too quickly glossed over ) , and I laughed a handful of times , so let 's go with a Grade : C+  The Cleveland Show : Then there 's this , which I 've sort of been making excuses for for a while now because the show was in its first 13 episodes and where the stories of a family attempting to blend together would trump the often lame cutaway gags - that I would eventually come to appreciate . Instead , the show seems to take one or two steps forward and then many more steps back . So while I more or less enjoyed the Christmas episode , there was something I found boring about this one . Worse , I only laughed at it a few times ( mostly during the opening segment set during 1984 with all of the rampant 1984 references followed by Cleveland saying , \" It was 1984 \" ) . Theoretically , I should be enjoying something like Cleveland trying to bond with his son , but this storyline was so predictable and one note that I could n't even be amused by Cleveland , Jr. , who 's my favorite character , except when he was pretending to fly around like a butterfly . There are some good jokes around the edges of this episode , but overall , it 's got ta be considered a dud . Grade : C-  Family Guy : This The Family Feud riff was nicely elaborate and full of some nice little jokes ( I liked Meg 's suggestion of razors and a note being turned into \" Sundries \" on the big board ) , even if the Richard Dawson stuff was all about the easiest possible series of Richard Dawson jokes one could make . I even enjoyed the adult swim bumper cards runner that closed out the first act with the show mocking itself for doing an amnesia plotline . But from there , the episode just devolved into a fairly typical amnesia storyline , with Peter losing his memory and then getting it back and having to relearn being a family guy ( tee hee ) along the way . Naturally , this being Family Guy , he decided that being a bachelor was more fun , then had to save his wife from having sex with Quagmire . And the episode ended with Quagmire trying to use electroshock paddles to stimulate his penis . I mean , I get that Family Guy is never going to have storylines that are surprising in the least , use those storylines as a thin spine to hang jokes on , then the jokes should be funnier . They were n't tonight , and this was mostly a waste of a half hour , even as I think this season , overall , had been pretty good . Grade : D  American Dad : Here 's the opposite problem of Family Guy . I found the first two-thirds of this episode fairly listless , as the show wandered into commentary on the recession by showing how the Smiths were trying to cut back but Stan was still running his gas guzzling SUV . All of this led to Stan buying a horse but blowing way too much of the family 's savings on it , leading to Francine hating the horse and , also , just a little bit , Stan . Meanwhile , Steve and pals were trying to get a fat guy off of his bed , only to have one of them disappear beneath the fat guy . But the last third of the episode - featuring Klaus ' anger at not being put back into the solution to Steve 's problems - was actually quite funny , packing the most laughs of anything in the bloc for the evening . You often hear in articles about TV writers rooms about a big white board where possible plotlines are written down , just in case the writers run out of ideas for new episodes . I kind of wonder just how long \" Stan becomes a horse \" was written on the American Dad board , but there was something goofily charming about the way this all played out - much less the way that everything tied together in the end - that made the episode end on a high enough note for me to give it a Grade : B  Stray observations :  Next week is the big Simpsons anniversary thing . Naturally , I 'll write up the new episodes , but do you guys want coverage of the documentary special ? I come to serve , as the Elven Rangers used to say in Warcraft II . \" They 'll cheer a dancing octopus , but not an old man complaining about NONE of his courses . Please call me , BART 'S BIGGEST FAN . Edna Karbappel . \" \" You do n't get a beating like this riding in a plane . \" \" Ah ! Sewer cats ! \" \" He learned the lesson he learned 25 years ago : Mess with me , and you 're gon na pee on your thigh and pocket contents . \" \" Well , I 'll be a son of a bitch . \" \" What is it , dad ? \" \" It 's a HORSE , and it 's racing today . \" \" If you do n't stop doing that , I 'm gon na come to your house and kick your mom to death while you watch . \" \" It 's not perfect for me , Steve ! \" \" Why are we holding hands ? \" \" How else will people know we 're gay ? \"   "
