Why did the suspect he was tracking have to frequent clubs like this ? Sherlock hated clubs . Surely he was to go mad before the person in question walked through the door . Stupid Mycroft sending Sherlock all the way to America tracking some MI6 deserter . What did it matter if he had stolen ‘ state secrets.’ Sherlock could find the information from any one of the hundreds of homeless network he has , and they sleep in crack dens on a nightly basis . He supposed it was better than the alternative , going with his parents to see a musical they had tickets to . Sherlock shuddered at the thought . No this was much better .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "30    “ How about I just make you something and see if you like it ? ” Sherlock nodded . Had he lost the ability to form a sentence ? The bartender turned his back and began pouring various liquids in the shaking tin . As soon as Sherlock had lost contact with the distracting eyes he began processing all he had seen .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "31    The Bartender had an English accent , possibly north London . His posture suggested military , as did his haircut . He ’d been injured , he was favouring his left arm . Possible gunshot wound . The tan lines on the back of his neck and wrist suggest somewhere that had been adorned with constant sun . So Afganistan or Iraq . Now that he had his back to him Sherlock was only slightly distracted by his rather attractive ass . FOCUS ! He shook his head as he deduced more . He moved as if he was uncomfortable with the movements . So fairly new as a bartender then . The sleeves of his shirt had been rolled up to the elbow and Sherlock could just barely make out the bottom of a tattoo on his forearm . Harry ? Hmm , could be a significant other ? No , the Bartender did n’t seem to be the non - sensible type . So a family member then . One only gets a tattoo of a family member if they ’re deceased or a child . So which one ? The Bartender stretched upward at that moment to reveal a date on the tattoo . Dated nearly ten years ago . Sherlock estimated the age of the Bartender around thirty . So leaning toward family member . The Bartender had a ring on his right hand from Bart ’s medical college . So a doctor . An army doctor ? Intriguing . Sherlock startled as the Bartender placed the new drink in front of him . Sherlock glanced up then took a sip of the purple liquid in front of him . It was good . Refreshing actually . Vodka . Cranberry . What else was that ? He looked back up at the Bartender and smiled .\n",

       "36    Since when did Sherlock like to chat ? He looked to his watch . He had been here for approximately 3 hours . The main time for entry had passed and he supposed the target was n’t likely to show up tonight . He turned back toward where the Bartender was serving another drink to a customer . He locked eyes with Sherlock and Sherlock felt his stomach flip at the intensity of his gaze . Sherlock made the universal sign to close his tab and waved good - bye . Forcing himself to turn his back on the gaze of the man , he gathered his coat and scarf and turned toward the door .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "37    “ Going so soon ? ” The Bartender ’s voice was much closer than Sherlock had expected anyone ’s to be . Sherlock suspected that if he turned around he would come nose to nose with the man . He did n’t quite trust himself with the proximity so he took a half step forward and turn around . His words caught in his throat as he looked at the man before him . He had n’t noticed how short the man was while he had been sitting . The man was nearly a half foot shorter than himself . A piece of hair had fallen from it ’s neat style and was hanging down his forehead and Sherlock found himself wanting nothing more than to brush it back into place . He cleared his throat once , then once more for good measure .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
